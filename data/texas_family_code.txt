Sec. 3.402. CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT; OFFSETS. (a) A claim for
reimbursement exists when one or both spouses use property of one
marital estate to confer on the property of another marital estate a
benefit which, if not repaid, would result in unjust enrichment to
the benefited estate.
(b) A spouse seeking reimbursement to a marital estate must
prove:
(1) that the spouse or both spouses used property of the
marital estate to confer a benefit on the property of another marital
estate;
(2) the value of the benefit described by Subdivision (1);
and
(3) that unjust enrichment of the benefited estate will
occur if the benefited estate is not required to reimburse the
conferring estate.
(c) For purposes of this subchapter, the property of a marital
estate confers a benefit on another marital estate's property if:
(1) one or both spouses used property of the conferring
estate to pay a debt, liability, or expense that in equity and good
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 37 -
conscience should have been paid from the benefited estate's
property;
(2) one or both spouses used property of the conferring
estate to make improvements on the benefited estate's real property,
and the improvements resulted in an enhancement in the value of the
benefited estate's real property; or
(3) one or both spouses used time, toil, talent, or effort
to enhance the value of property of a spouse's separate estate beyond
that which was reasonably necessary to manage and preserve the
spouse's separate property, and for which the community marital
estate did not receive adequate compensation.
(d) For purposes of this subchapter, the value of the benefit
conferred by the property of one marital estate on the property of
another marital estate is determined as of the date of the trial's
commencement and:
(1) if the benefit resulted from the use of the conferring
estate's property to pay a debt, liability, or expense that in equity
and good conscience should have been paid from the benefited estate's
property, then the value of the benefit conferred is measured by the
amount of the debt, liability, or expense paid by the conferring
estate;
(2) if the benefit resulted from the use of the conferring
estate's property to make improvements on the benefited estate's real
property, then the value of the benefit conferred is measured by the
enhancement in the value of the benefited estate's real property that
resulted from the improvements; or
(3) if the benefit resulted from the use of time, toil,
talent, or effort to enhance the value of property of a spouse's
separate estate, then the value of the benefit conferred is measured
by the value of the time, toil, talent, or effort beyond that which
was reasonably necessary to manage and preserve the spouse's separate
property.
(e) The determination of whether unjust enrichment will occur
if one marital estate is not required to reimburse another marital
estate is a question for the court to decide.
(f) The court shall resolve a claim for reimbursement by using
equitable principles, including the principle that claims for
reimbursement may be offset against each other if the court
determines it to be appropriate.
(g) A claim for reimbursement of a marital estate by one spouse
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 38 -
may be offset by the value of any related benefit that the other
spouse proves that the conferring estate received from the benefited
estate, including:
(1) the value of the use and enjoyment of the property by
the conferring estate, except that the separate marital estate of a
spouse may not claim an offset for use and enjoyment of a primary or
secondary residence owned wholly or partly by the separate marital
estate against contributions made by the community marital estate to
the separate marital estate;
(2) income received by the conferring estate from the
property of the benefited estate; or
(3) any reduction in the amount of any income tax
obligation of the conferring estate by virtue of the conferring
estate claiming tax-deductible items relating to the property of the
benefited estate, such as depreciation, interest, taxes, maintenance,
or other deductible payments.
(h) The party seeking an offset to a claim for reimbursement
has the burden of proof with respect to the offset.

Sec. 8.059. ENFORCEMENT OF MAINTENANCE ORDER. (a) The court
may enforce by contempt against the obligor:
(1) the court's maintenance order; or
(2) an agreement for periodic payments of spousal
maintenance under the terms of this chapter voluntarily entered into
between the parties and approved by the court.
(a-1) The court may not enforce by contempt any provision of an
agreed order for maintenance that exceeds the amount of periodic
support the court could have ordered under this chapter or for any
period of maintenance beyond the period of maintenance the court
could have ordered under this chapter.
(b) On the suit to enforce by an obligee, the court may render
judgment against a defaulting party for the amount of arrearages
after notice by service of citation, answer, if any, and a hearing
finding that the defaulting party has failed or refused to comply
with the terms of the order. The judgment may be enforced by any
means available for the enforcement of judgment for debts, including
by an order or writ of withholding and a maintenance qualified
domestic relations order under Subchapter H.
(c) It is an affirmative defense to an allegation of contempt
of court or the violation of a condition of probation requiring
payment of court-ordered maintenance that the obligor:
(1) lacked the ability to provide maintenance in the amount
ordered;
(2) lacked property that could be sold, mortgaged, or
otherwise pledged to raise the funds needed;
(3) attempted unsuccessfully to borrow the needed funds;
and
(4) did not know of a source from which the money could
have been borrowed or otherwise legally obtained.
(d) The issue of the existence of an affirmative defense does
not arise until pleaded. An obligor must prove the affirmative
defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

costs in addition to the amount of the overpaid maintenance. For
good cause shown, the court may waive the requirement that the

Sec. 33.002. PARENTAL NOTICE. (a) A physician may not perform
an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor unless:
(1) the physician performing the abortion gives at least 48
hours actual notice, in person or by telephone, of the physician's
FAMILY CODE
CHAPTER 33. NOTICE OF AND CONSENT TO ABORTION
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 160 -
intent to perform the abortion to:
(A) a parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing
conservator or guardian; or
(B) a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian;
(2) the physician who is to perform the abortion receives
an order issued by a court under Section 33.003 or 33.004 authorizing
the minor to consent to the abortion as provided by Section 33.003 or
33.004; or
(3) the physician who is to perform the abortion:
(A) concludes that a medical emergency exists;
(B) certifies in writing to the Department of State
Health Services and in the patient's medical record the medical
indications supporting the physician's judgment that a medical
emergency exists; and
(C) provides the notice required by Section 33.0022.
(b) If a person to whom notice may be given under Subsection
(a)(1) cannot be notified after a reasonable effort, a physician may
perform an abortion if the physician gives 48 hours constructive
notice, by certified mail, restricted delivery, sent to the last
known address, to the person to whom notice may be given under
Subsection (a)(1). The period under this subsection begins when the
notice is mailed. If the person required to be notified is not
notified within the 48-hour period, the abortion may proceed even if
the notice by mail is not received.
(c) The requirement that 48 hours actual notice be provided
under this section may be waived by an affidavit of:
(1) a parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing
conservator or guardian; or
(2) a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian.
(d) A physician may execute for inclusion in the minor's
medical record an affidavit stating that, according to the best
information and belief of the physician, notice or constructive
notice has been provided as required by this section. Execution of
an affidavit under this subsection creates a presumption that the
requirements of this section have been satisfied.
(e) The Department of State Health Services shall prepare a
form to be used for making the certification required by Subsection
(a)(3)(B).
(f) A certification required by Subsection (a)(3)(B) is

Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 161 -
Chapter 552, Government Code, or to discovery, subpoena, or other
legal process. Personal or identifying information about the minor,
including her name, address, or social security number, may not be
included in a certification under Subsection (a)(3)(B). The
physician must keep the medical records on the minor in compliance
with the rules adopted by the Texas Medical Board under Section
153.003, Occupations Code.
(g) A physician who intentionally performs an abortion on a
pregnant unemancipated minor in violation of this section commits an
offense. An offense under this subsection is punishable by a fine
not to exceed $10,000. In this subsection, "intentionally" has the
meaning assigned by Section 6.03(a), Penal Code.
(h) It is a defense to prosecution under this section that the
minor falsely represented her age or identity to the physician to be
at least 18 years of age by displaying an apparently valid proof of
identity and age described by Subsection (k) such that a reasonable
person under similar circumstances would have relied on the
representation. The defense does not apply if the physician is shown
to have had independent knowledge of the minor's actual age or
identity or failed to use due diligence in determining the minor's
age or identity. In this subsection, "defense" has the meaning and
application assigned by Section 2.03, Penal Code.
(i) In relation to the trial of an offense under this section
in which the conduct charged involves a conclusion made by the
physician under Subsection (a)(3)(A), the defendant may seek a
hearing before the Texas Medical Board on whether the physician's
conduct was necessary because of a medical emergency. The findings
of the Texas Medical Board under this subsection are admissible on
that issue in the trial of the defendant. Notwithstanding any other
reason for a continuance provided under the Code of Criminal
Procedure or other law, on motion of the defendant, the court shall
delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit
a hearing under this subsection to take place.

woman on which the physician performs an abortion who claims to have
reached the age of majority or to have had the disabilities of
minority removed has, in fact, reached the age of majority or has had
the disabilities of minority removed.
(k) For the purposes of this section, "due diligence" includes
requesting proof of identity and age described by Section 2.005(b) or
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 162 -
a copy of the court order removing disabilities of minority.
(l) If proof of identity and age cannot be provided, the
physician shall provide information on how to obtain proof of
identity and age. If the woman is subsequently unable to obtain proof
of identity and age and the physician chooses to perform the
abortion, the physician shall document that proof of identity and age
was not obtained and report to the Department of State Health
Services that proof of identity and age was not obtained for the
woman on whom the abortion was performed. The department shall
report annually to the legislature regarding the number of abortions
performed without proof of identity and age.

exists and that there is insufficient time to provide the notice
required by Section 33.002 or obtain the consent required by Section
33.0021, the physician shall make a reasonable effort to inform, in
person or by telephone, the parent, managing conservator, or guardian
of the unemancipated minor within 24 hours after the time a medical
emergency abortion is performed on the minor of:
(1) the performance of the abortion; and
(2) the basis for the physician's determination that a
medical emergency existed that required the performance of a medical
emergency abortion without fulfilling the requirements of Section

records, to the last known address of the parent, managing

address information if a reasonable and prudent person, under similar
circumstances, would rely on the information as sufficient evidence

(1) the return receipt from the written notice; or
(2) if the notice was returned as undeliverable, the
notice.

minor during a medical emergency as described by Subsection (a) shall

Sec. 51.04. JURISDICTION. (a) This title covers the
proceedings in all cases involving the delinquent conduct or conduct
indicating a need for supervision engaged in by a person who was a
child within the meaning of this title at the time the person engaged
in the conduct, and, except as provided by Subsection (h) or Section
51.0414, the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction over
proceedings under this title.
(b) In each county, the county's juvenile board shall designate
one or more district, criminal district, domestic relations,
juvenile, or county courts or county courts at law as the juvenile
court, subject to Subsections (c), (d), and (i).
(c) If the county court is designated as a juvenile court, at
least one other court shall be designated as the juvenile court. A
county court does not have jurisdiction of a proceeding involving a
petition approved by a grand jury under Section 53.045 of this code.
(d) If the judge of a court designated in Subsection (b) or (c)
of this section is not an attorney licensed in this state, there
shall also be designated an alternate court, the judge of which is an
attorney licensed in this state.
(e) A designation made under Subsection (b), (c), or (i) may be
changed from time to time by the authorized boards or judges for the
convenience of the people and the welfare of children. However,
there must be at all times a juvenile court designated for each
county. It is the intent of the legislature that in selecting a
court to be the juvenile court of each county, the selection shall be
made as far as practicable so that the court designated as the
juvenile court will be one which is presided over by a judge who has
a sympathetic understanding of the problems of child welfare and that
changes in the designation of juvenile courts be made only when the
best interest of the public requires it.
(f) If the judge of the juvenile court or any alternate judge
named under Subsection (b) or (c) is not in the county or is
otherwise unavailable, any magistrate may make a determination under
Section 53.02(f) or may conduct the detention hearing provided for in
Section 54.01.
(g) The juvenile board may appoint a referee to make
determinations under Section 53.02(f) or to conduct hearings under
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 212 -
this title. The referee shall be an attorney licensed to practice
law in this state and shall comply with Section 54.10. Payment of
any referee services shall be provided from county funds.
(h) A judge exercising jurisdiction over a child in a suit
instituted under Subtitle E, Title 5, may refer any aspect of a suit
involving a dual status child that is instituted under this title to
the appropriate associate judge appointed under Subchapter C, Chapter
201, serving in the county and exercising jurisdiction over the child
under Subtitle E, Title 5, if the associate judge consents to the
referral. The scope of an associate judge's authority over a suit
referred under this subsection is subject to any limitations placed
by the court judge in the order of referral.
(i) If the court designated as the juvenile court under
Subsection (b) does not have jurisdiction over proceedings under
Subtitle E, Title 5, the county's juvenile board may designate at
least one other court that does have jurisdiction over proceedings
under Subtitle E, Title 5, as a juvenile court or alternative
juvenile court.

the case remanded to the court by the appellate court.
(b) If the respondent is at least 18 years of age when the
order of remand from the appellate court is received by the juvenile
court, the juvenile court shall proceed as provided by Sections
54.02(o)-(r) for the detention of a person at least 18 years of age
in discretionary transfer proceedings. Pending retrial of the
adjudication or transfer proceeding, the juvenile court may:

facility; or

adult facility if bond is not made.

modification proceedings.
(h) The juvenile court of the sending county may revoke
probation for a violation of a condition imposed by the juvenile
court of the sending county only if the condition has not been

receiving county. The juvenile court of the receiving county may
revoke probation for a violation of a condition of probation that the
juvenile court of the receiving county has modified or imposed.

probation term; or

sending county resume direct supervision for the child.
(j) On receiving a directive from the juvenile court of the
receiving county under Subsection (i)(2), the juvenile probation
department of the sending county shall arrange for the prompt
transportation of the child back to the sending county at the expense

judicial proceedings in the sending county or on the completion of
any residential placement ordered by the juvenile court of the
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 222 -

the receiving county;
(2) the child has been ordered by the juvenile court of the
sending county to reside with a parent, guardian, or other person who
resides in the sending county or any other county; and

collaborative supervision.
(j-2) The period of interim supervision under Subsection (j-1)
may not exceed the period under Subsection (m).
(k) The juvenile probation department of the receiving county
is entitled to any probation supervision fees collected from the
child or the child's parent while providing interim supervision for
the child. During the period of interim supervision, the receiving
county shall collect and distribute to the victim monetary
restitution payments in the manner specified by the sending county.
At the expiration of the period of interim supervision, the receiving
county shall collect and distribute directly to the victim any
remaining payments.
(l) The sending county is financially responsible for any
special treatment program or placement that the juvenile court of the
sending county requires as a condition of probation.
(m) Except as provided by Subsection (n), a period of interim
supervision may not exceed 180 days. Permanent supervision
automatically transfers to the juvenile probation department of the
receiving county after the expiration of the period of interim
supervision. The juvenile probation department of the receiving
county may request permanent supervision from the juvenile probation
department of the sending county at any time before the 180-day
interim supervision period expires. After signing and entry of an
order of transfer of permanent supervision by the sending county
juvenile court, the juvenile probation department shall, in
accordance with Section 51.073(b), promptly send the permanent
supervision order and related documents to the receiving county.
(m-1) If a child on interim supervision moves to another county
of residence or is otherwise no longer in the receiving county before
the expiration of 180 days, the receiving county shall direct the
sending county to resume supervision of the child.
FAMILY CODE

the greater of either 180 days or one-third of the term of probation,
including one-third of the term of any extension of the probation
term ordered under Section 54.05. Permanent supervision
automatically transfers to the probation department of the receiving
county after the expiration of the period of interim supervision
under this subsection. If the state elects to initiate transfer
proceedings under Section 54.051, the juvenile court of the sending
county may order transfer of the permanent supervision before the
expiration of the period of interim supervision under this
subsection.
(o) At least once every 90 days during the period of interim
supervision, the juvenile probation department of the receiving
county shall provide the juvenile probation department of the sending
county with a progress report of supervision concerning the child.

CHAPTER 54. JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
Sec. 54.01. DETENTION HEARING. (a) Except as provided by
Subsection (p), if the child is not released under Section 53.02, a
detention hearing without a jury shall be held promptly, but not
later than the second working day after the child is taken into
custody; provided, however, that when a child is detained on a
Friday or Saturday, then such detention hearing shall be held on the
first working day after the child is taken into custody.
(b) Reasonable notice of the detention hearing, either oral or
written, shall be given, stating the time, place, and purpose of the
hearing. Notice shall be given to the child and, if they can be
found, to his parents, guardian, or custodian. Prior to the
commencement of the hearing, the court shall inform the parties of
the child's right to counsel and to appointed counsel if they are
indigent and of the child's right to remain silent with respect to
any allegations of delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for
supervision, or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed
by a juvenile court.
(b-1) Unless the court finds that the appointment of counsel is
not feasible due to exigent circumstances, the court shall appoint
counsel within a reasonable time before the first detention hearing
is held to represent the child at that hearing.
(c) At the detention hearing, the court may consider written
reports from probation officers, professional court employees,
guardians ad litem appointed under Section 51.11(d), or professional
consultants in addition to the testimony of witnesses. Prior to the
detention hearing, the court shall provide the attorney for the child
with access to all written matter to be considered by the court in
making the detention decision. The court may order counsel not to
reveal items to the child or the child's parent, guardian, or
guardian ad litem if such disclosure would materially harm the
treatment and rehabilitation of the child or would substantially
decrease the likelihood of receiving information from the same or
similar sources in the future.
(d) A detention hearing may be held without the presence of the
child's parents if the court has been unable to locate them. If no
parent or guardian is present, the court shall appoint counsel or a
guardian ad litem for the child, subject to the requirements of
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 283 -
Subsection (b-1).
(e) At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall order the
child released from detention unless it finds that:
(1) he is likely to abscond or be removed from the
jurisdiction of the court;
(2) suitable supervision, care, or protection for him is
not being provided by a parent, guardian, custodian, or other person;
(3) he has no parent, guardian, custodian, or other person
able to return him to the court when required;
(4) he may be dangerous to himself or may threaten the
safety of the public if released; or
(5) he has previously been found to be a delinquent child
or has previously been convicted of a penal offense punishable by a
term in jail or prison and is likely to commit an offense if
released.
(f) Unless otherwise agreed in the memorandum of understanding
under Section 37.011, Education Code, a release may be conditioned on
requirements reasonably necessary to insure the child's appearance at
later proceedings, but the conditions of the release must be in
writing and a copy furnished to the child. In a county with a
population greater than 125,000, if a child being released under this
section is expelled under Section 37.007, Education Code, the release
shall be conditioned on the child's attending a juvenile justice
alternative education program pending a deferred prosecution or
formal court disposition of the child's case.
(g) No statement made by the child at the detention hearing
shall be admissible against the child at any other hearing.
(h) A detention order extends to the conclusion of the
disposition hearing, if there is one, but in no event for more than
10 working days. Further detention orders may be made following
subsequent detention hearings. The initial detention hearing may not
be waived but subsequent detention hearings may be waived in
accordance with the requirements of Section 51.09. Each subsequent
detention order shall extend for no more than 10 working days, except
that in a county that does not have a certified juvenile detention
facility, as described by Section 51.12(a)(3), each subsequent
detention order shall extend for no more than 15 working days.
(i) A child in custody may be detained for as long as 10 days
without the hearing described in Subsection (a) of this section if:
(1) a written request for shelter in detention facilities
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 284 -
pending arrangement of transportation to his place of residence in
another state or country or another county of this state is
voluntarily executed by the child not later than the next working day
after he was taken into custody;
(2) the request for shelter contains:
(A) a statement by the child that he voluntarily agrees
to submit himself to custody and detention for a period of not longer
than 10 days without a detention hearing;
(B) an allegation by the person detaining the child
that the child has left his place of residence in another state or
country or another county of this state, that he is in need of
shelter, and that an effort is being made to arrange transportation
to his place of residence; and
(C) a statement by the person detaining the child that
he has advised the child of his right to demand a detention hearing
under Subsection (a) of this section; and
(3) the request is signed by the juvenile court judge to
evidence his knowledge of the fact that the child is being held in
detention.
(j) The request for shelter may be revoked by the child at any
time, and on such revocation, if further detention is necessary, a
detention hearing shall be held not later than the next working day
in accordance with Subsections (a) through (g) of this section.
(k) Notwithstanding anything in this title to the contrary, the
child may sign a request for shelter without the concurrence of an
adult specified in Section 51.09 of this code.
(l) The juvenile board may appoint a referee to conduct the
detention hearing. The referee shall be an attorney licensed to
practice law in this state. Such payment or additional payment as
may be warranted for referee services shall be provided from county
funds. Before commencing the detention hearing, the referee shall
inform the parties who have appeared that they are entitled to have
the hearing before the juvenile court judge or a substitute judge
authorized by Section 51.04(f). If a party objects to the referee
conducting the detention hearing, an authorized judge shall conduct
the hearing within 24 hours. At the conclusion of the hearing, the
referee shall transmit written findings and recommendations to the
juvenile court judge or substitute judge. The juvenile court judge
or substitute judge shall adopt, modify, or reject the referee's
recommendations not later than the next working day after the day
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 285 -
that the judge receives the recommendations. Failure to act within
that time results in release of the child by operation of law. A
recommendation that the child be released operates to secure the
child's immediate release, subject to the power of the juvenile court
judge or substitute judge to reject or modify that recommendation.
The effect of an order detaining a child shall be computed from the
time of the hearing before the referee.
(m) The detention hearing required in this section may be held
in the county of the designated place of detention where the child is
being held even though the designated place of detention is outside
the county of residence of the child or the county in which the
alleged delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for
supervision, or probation violation occurred.
(n) An attorney appointed by the court under Section 51.10(c)
because a determination was made under this section to detain a child
who was not represented by an attorney may request on behalf of the
child and is entitled to a de novo detention hearing under this
section. The attorney must make the request not later than the 10th
working day after the date the attorney is appointed. The hearing
must take place not later than the second working day after the date
the attorney filed a formal request with the court for a hearing.
(o) The court or referee shall find whether there is probable
cause to believe that a child taken into custody without an arrest
warrant or a directive to apprehend has engaged in delinquent
conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or conduct that
violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court. The
court or referee must make the finding within 48 hours, including
weekends and holidays, of the time the child was taken into custody.
The court or referee may make the finding on any reasonably reliable
information without regard to admissibility of that information under
the Texas Rules of Evidence. A finding of probable cause is required
to detain a child after the 48th hour after the time the child was
taken into custody. If a court or referee finds probable cause,
additional findings of probable cause are not required in the same
cause to authorize further detention.
(p) If a child is detained in a county jail or other facility
as provided by Section 51.12(l) and the child is not released under
Section 53.02(f), a detention hearing without a jury shall be held
promptly, but not later than the 24th hour, excluding weekends and
holidays, after the time the child is taken into custody.
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 286 -
(q) If a child has not been released under Section 53.02 or
this section and a petition has not been filed under Section 53.04 or
54.05 concerning the child, the court shall order the child released
from detention not later than:
(1) the 30th working day after the date the initial
detention hearing is held, if the child is alleged to have engaged in
conduct constituting a capital felony, an aggravated controlled
substance felony, or a felony of the first degree; or
(2) the 15th working day after the date the initial
detention hearing is held, if the child is alleged to have engaged in
conduct constituting an offense other than an offense listed in
Subdivision (1) or conduct that violates an order of probation
imposed by a juvenile court.
(q-1) The juvenile board may impose an earlier deadline than
the specified deadlines for filing petitions under Subsection (q) and
may specify the consequences of not filing a petition by the deadline
the juvenile board has established. The juvenile board may authorize
but not require the juvenile court to release a respondent from
detention for failure of the prosecutor to file a petition by the
juvenile board's deadline.
(r) On the conditional release of a child from detention by
judicial order under Subsection (f), the court, referee, or detention
magistrate may order that the child's parent, guardian, or custodian
present in court at the detention hearing engage in acts or omissions
specified by the court, referee, or detention magistrate that will
assist the child in complying with the conditions of release. The
order must be in writing and a copy furnished to the parent,
guardian, or custodian. An order entered under this subsection may
be enforced as provided by Chapter 61.

Sec. 54.011. DETENTION HEARINGS FOR STATUS OFFENDERS AND
NONOFFENDERS; PENALTY. (a) The detention hearing for a status
offender or nonoffender who has not been released administratively
under Section 53.02 shall be held before the 24th hour after the time
the child arrived at a detention facility, excluding hours of a
weekend or a holiday. Except as otherwise provided by this section,
the judge or referee conducting the detention hearing shall release
the status offender or nonoffender from secure detention.
(b) The judge or referee may order a child in detention accused
of the violation of a valid court order as defined by Section 51.02
detained not longer than 72 hours after the time the detention order
was entered, excluding weekends and holidays, if:
(1) the judge or referee finds at the detention hearing
that there is probable cause to believe the child violated the valid
court order; and
(2) the detention of the child is justified under Section
54.01(e)(1), (2), or (3).
(c) Except as provided by Subsection (d), a detention order
entered under Subsection (b) may be extended for one additional 72-
hour period, excluding weekends and holidays, only on a finding of
good cause by the juvenile court.
(d) A detention order for a child under this section may be
extended on the demand of the child's attorney only to allow the time
that is necessary to comply with the requirements of Section
51.10(h), entitling the attorney to 10 days to prepare for an
adjudication hearing.
(e) A status offender may be detained for a necessary period,

(f) Except as provided by Subsection (a), a nonoffender,
including a person who has been taken into custody and is being held
solely for deportation out of the United States, may not be detained
for any period of time in a secure detention facility or secure
correctional facility, regardless of whether the facility is publicly
or privately operated. A nonoffender who is detained in violation of
this subsection is entitled to immediate release from the facility
and may bring a civil action for compensation for the illegal
detention against any person responsible for the detention. A person
commits an offense if the person knowingly detains or assists in
detaining a nonoffender in a secure detention facility or secure
correctional facility in violation of this subsection. An offense
under this subsection is a Class B misdemeanor.

Sec. 54.02. WAIVER OF JURISDICTION AND DISCRETIONARY TRANSFER
TO CRIMINAL COURT. (a) The juvenile court may waive its exclusive
original jurisdiction and transfer a child to the appropriate
district court or criminal district court for criminal proceedings
if:
(1) the child is alleged to have violated a penal law of
the grade of felony;
(2) the child was:
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 290 -
(A) 14 years of age or older at the time he is alleged
to have committed the offense, if the offense is a capital felony, an
aggravated controlled substance felony, or a felony of the first
degree, and no adjudication hearing has been conducted concerning
that offense; or
(B) 15 years of age or older at the time the child is
alleged to have committed the offense, if the offense is a felony of
the second or third degree or a state jail felony, and no
adjudication hearing has been conducted concerning that offense; and
(3) after a full investigation and a hearing, the juvenile
court determines that there is probable cause to believe that the
child before the court committed the offense alleged and that because
of the seriousness of the offense alleged or the background of the
child the welfare of the community requires criminal proceedings.
(b) The petition and notice requirements of Sections 53.04,
53.05, 53.06, and 53.07 of this code must be satisfied, and the
summons must state that the hearing is for the purpose of considering
discretionary transfer to criminal court.
(c) The juvenile court shall conduct a hearing without a jury
to consider transfer of the child for criminal proceedings.
(d) Prior to the hearing, the juvenile court shall order and
obtain a complete diagnostic study, social evaluation, and full
investigation of the child, his circumstances, and the circumstances
of the alleged offense.
(e) At the transfer hearing the court may consider written
reports from probation officers, professional court employees,
guardians ad litem appointed under Section 51.11(d), or professional
consultants in addition to the testimony of witnesses. At least five
days prior to the transfer hearing, the court shall provide the
attorney for the child and the prosecuting attorney with access to
all written matter to be considered by the court in making the
transfer decision. The court may order counsel not to reveal items
to the child or the child's parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem if
such disclosure would materially harm the treatment and
rehabilitation of the child or would substantially decrease the
likelihood of receiving information from the same or similar sources
in the future.
(f) In making the determination required by Subsection (a) of
this section, the court shall consider, among other matters:
(1) whether the alleged offense was against person or
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 291 -
property, with greater weight in favor of transfer given to offenses
against the person;
(2) the sophistication and maturity of the child;
(3) the record and previous history of the child; and
(4) the prospects of adequate protection of the public and
the likelihood of the rehabilitation of the child by use of
procedures, services, and facilities currently available to the
juvenile court.
(g) If the petition alleges multiple offenses that constitute
more than one criminal transaction, the juvenile court shall either
retain or transfer all offenses relating to a single transaction.
Except as provided by Subsection (g-1), a child is not subject to
criminal prosecution at any time for any offense arising out of a
criminal transaction for which the juvenile court retains
jurisdiction.
(g-1) A child may be subject to criminal prosecution for an
offense committed under Chapter 19 or Section 49.08, Penal Code, if:
(1) the offense arises out of a criminal transaction for
which the juvenile court retained jurisdiction over other offenses
relating to the criminal transaction; and
(2) on or before the date the juvenile court retained
jurisdiction, one or more of the elements of the offense under
Chapter 19 or Section 49.08, Penal Code, had not occurred.
(h) If the juvenile court waives jurisdiction, it shall state
specifically in the order its reasons for waiver and certify its
action, including the written order and findings of the court, and
shall transfer the person to the appropriate court for criminal
proceedings and cause the results of the diagnostic study of the
person ordered under Subsection (d), including psychological
information, to be transferred to the appropriate criminal
prosecutor. On transfer of the person for criminal proceedings, the
person shall be dealt with as an adult and in accordance with the
Code of Criminal Procedure, except that if detention in a certified
juvenile detention facility is authorized under Section 152.0015,
Human Resources Code, the juvenile court may order the person to be
detained in the facility pending trial or until the criminal court
enters an order under Article 4.19, Code of Criminal Procedure. A
transfer of custody made under this subsection is an arrest.
(h-1) If the juvenile court orders a person detained in a
certified juvenile detention facility under Subsection (h), the
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 292 -
juvenile court shall set or deny bond for the person as required by
the Code of Criminal Procedure and other law applicable to the
pretrial detention of adults accused of criminal offenses.
(i) A waiver under this section is a waiver of jurisdiction
over the child and the criminal court may not remand the child to the
jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
(j) The juvenile court may waive its exclusive original
jurisdiction and transfer a person to the appropriate district court
or criminal district court for criminal proceedings if:
(1) the person is 18 years of age or older;
(2) the person was:
(A) 10 years of age or older and under 17 years of age
at the time the person is alleged to have committed a capital felony
or an offense under Section 19.02, Penal Code;
(B) 14 years of age or older and under 17 years of age
at the time the person is alleged to have committed an aggravated
controlled substance felony or a felony of the first degree other
than an offense under Section 19.02, Penal Code; or
(C) 15 years of age or older and under 17 years of age
at the time the person is alleged to have committed a felony of the
second or third degree or a state jail felony;
(3) no adjudication concerning the alleged offense has been
made or no adjudication hearing concerning the offense has been
conducted;
(4) the juvenile court finds from a preponderance of the
evidence that:
(A) for a reason beyond the control of the state it was
not practicable to proceed in juvenile court before the 18th birthday
of the person; or
(B) after due diligence of the state it was not
practicable to proceed in juvenile court before the 18th birthday of
the person because:
(i) the state did not have probable cause to
proceed in juvenile court and new evidence has been found since the
18th birthday of the person;
(ii) the person could not be found; or
(iii) a previous transfer order was reversed by an
appellate court or set aside by a district court; and
(5) the juvenile court determines that there is probable
cause to believe that the child before the court committed the
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 293 -
offense alleged.
(k) The petition and notice requirements of Sections 53.04,
53.05, 53.06, and 53.07 of this code must be satisfied, and the
summons must state that the hearing is for the purpose of considering
waiver of jurisdiction under Subsection (j). The person's parent,
custodian, guardian, or guardian ad litem is not considered a party
to a proceeding under Subsection (j) and it is not necessary to
provide the parent, custodian, guardian, or guardian ad litem with
notice.
(l) The juvenile court shall conduct a hearing without a jury
to consider waiver of jurisdiction under Subsection (j). Except as
otherwise provided by this subsection, a waiver of jurisdiction under
Subsection (j) may be made without the necessity of conducting the
diagnostic study or complying with the requirements of discretionary
transfer proceedings under Subsection (d). If requested by the
attorney for the person at least 10 days before the transfer hearing,
the court shall order that the person be examined pursuant to Section
51.20(a) and that the results of the examination be provided to the
attorney for the person and the attorney for the state at least five
days before the transfer hearing.
(m) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the
juvenile court shall waive its exclusive original jurisdiction and
transfer a child to the appropriate district court or criminal court
for criminal proceedings if:
(1) the child has previously been transferred to a district
court or criminal district court for criminal proceedings under this
section, unless:
(A) the child was not indicted in the matter
transferred by the grand jury;
(B) the child was found not guilty in the matter
transferred;
(C) the matter transferred was dismissed with
prejudice; or
(D) the child was convicted in the matter transferred,
the conviction was reversed on appeal, and the appeal is final; and
(2) the child is alleged to have violated a penal law of
the grade of felony.
(n) A mandatory transfer under Subsection (m) may be made
without conducting the study required in discretionary transfer
proceedings by Subsection (d). The requirements of Subsection (b)
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 294 -
that the summons state that the purpose of the hearing is to consider
discretionary transfer to criminal court does not apply to a transfer
proceeding under Subsection (m). In a proceeding under Subsection
(m), it is sufficient that the summons provide fair notice that the
purpose of the hearing is to consider mandatory transfer to criminal
court.
(o) If a respondent is taken into custody for possible
discretionary transfer proceedings under Subsection (j), the juvenile
court shall hold a detention hearing in the same manner as provided
by Section 54.01, except that the court shall order the respondent
released unless it finds that the respondent:
(1) is likely to abscond or be removed from the
jurisdiction of the court;
(2) may be dangerous to himself or herself or may threaten
the safety of the public if released; or
(3) has previously been found to be a delinquent child or
has previously been convicted of a penal offense punishable by a term
of jail or prison and is likely to commit an offense if released.
(p) If the juvenile court does not order a respondent released
under Subsection (o), the court shall, pending the conclusion of the
discretionary transfer hearing, order that the respondent be detained
in:
(1) a certified juvenile detention facility as provided by
Subsection (q); or
(2) an appropriate county facility for the detention of
adults accused of criminal offenses.
(q) The detention of a respondent in a certified juvenile
detention facility must comply with the detention requirements under
this title, except that, to the extent practicable, the person shall
be kept separate from children detained in the same facility.
(r) If the juvenile court orders a respondent detained in a
county facility under Subsection (p), the county sheriff shall take
custody of the respondent under the juvenile court's order. The
juvenile court shall set or deny bond for the respondent as required
by the Code of Criminal Procedure and other law applicable to the
pretrial detention of adults accused of criminal offenses.
(s) If a child is transferred to criminal court under this
section, only the petition for discretionary transfer, the order of
transfer, and the order of commitment, if any, are a part of the
district clerk's public record.

Sec. 54.03. ADJUDICATION HEARING. (a) A child may be found to
have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for
supervision only after an adjudication hearing conducted in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
(b) At the beginning of the adjudication hearing, the juvenile
court judge shall explain to the child and his parent, guardian, or
guardian ad litem:
(1) the allegations made against the child;
(2) the nature and possible consequences of the
proceedings, including the law relating to the admissibility of the
record of a juvenile court adjudication in a criminal proceeding;
(3) the child's privilege against self-incrimination;
(4) the child's right to trial and to confrontation of
witnesses;
(5) the child's right to representation by an attorney if
he is not already represented; and
(6) the child's right to trial by jury.
(c) Trial shall be by jury unless jury is waived in accordance
with Section 51.09. If the hearing is on a petition that has been
approved by the grand jury under Section 53.045, the jury must
consist of 12 persons and be selected in accordance with the
requirements in criminal cases. If the hearing is on a petition that
alleges conduct that violates a penal law of this state of the grade
of misdemeanor, the jury must consist of the number of persons
required by Article 33.01(b), Code of Criminal Procedure. Jury
verdicts under this title must be unanimous.
(d) Except as provided by Section 54.031, only material,
relevant, and competent evidence in accordance with the Texas Rules
of Evidence applicable to criminal cases and Chapter 38, Code of
Criminal Procedure, may be considered in the adjudication hearing.
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 297 -
Except in a detention or discretionary transfer hearing, a social
history report or social service file shall not be viewed by the
court before the adjudication decision and shall not be viewed by the
jury at any time.
(e) A child alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct or
conduct indicating a need for supervision need not be a witness
against nor otherwise incriminate himself. An extrajudicial
statement which was obtained without fulfilling the requirements of
this title or of the constitution of this state or the United States,
may not be used in an adjudication hearing. A statement made by the
child out of court is insufficient to support a finding of delinquent
conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision unless it is
corroborated in whole or in part by other evidence. An adjudication
of delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision
cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated
by other evidence tending to connect the child with the alleged
delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision; and
the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission
of the alleged conduct. Evidence illegally seized or obtained is
inadmissible in an adjudication hearing.
(f) At the conclusion of the adjudication hearing, the court or
jury shall find whether or not the child has engaged in delinquent
conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision. The finding
must be based on competent evidence admitted at the hearing. The
child shall be presumed to be innocent of the charges against the
child and no finding that a child has engaged in delinquent conduct
or conduct indicating a need for supervision may be returned unless
the state has proved such beyond a reasonable doubt. In all jury
cases the jury will be instructed that the burden is on the state to
prove that a child has engaged in delinquent conduct or is in need of
supervision beyond a reasonable doubt. A child may be adjudicated as
having engaged in conduct constituting a lesser included offense as
provided by Articles 37.08 and 37.09, Code of Criminal Procedure.
(g) If the court or jury finds that the child did not engage in
delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision, the
court shall dismiss the case with prejudice.
(h) If the finding is that the child did engage in delinquent
conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision, the court or
jury shall state which of the allegations in the petition were found
to be established by the evidence. The court shall also set a date
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 298 -
and time for the disposition hearing.
(i) In order to preserve for appellate or collateral review the
failure of the court to provide the child the explanation required by
Subsection (b), the attorney for the child must comply with Rule
33.1, Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, before testimony begins or,
if the adjudication is uncontested, before the child pleads to the
petition or agrees to a stipulation of evidence.
(j) When the state and the child agree to the disposition of
the case, in whole or in part, the prosecuting attorney shall inform
the court of the agreement between the state and the child. The
court shall inform the child that the court is not required to accept
the agreement. The court may delay a decision on whether to accept
the agreement until after reviewing a report filed under Section
54.04(b). If the court decides not to accept the agreement, the
court shall inform the child of the court's decision and give the
child an opportunity to withdraw the plea or stipulation of evidence.
If the court rejects the agreement, no document, testimony, or other
evidence placed before the court that relates to the rejected
agreement may be considered by the court in a subsequent hearing in
the case. A statement made by the child before the court's rejection
of the agreement to a person writing a report to be filed under
Section 54.04(b) may not be admitted into evidence in a subsequent
hearing in the case. If the court accepts the agreement, the court
shall make a disposition in accordance with the terms of the
agreement between the state and the child.

the testimony of witnesses. On or before the second day before the
date of the disposition hearing, the court shall provide the attorney
for the child and the prosecuting attorney with access to all written
matter to be considered by the court in disposition. The court may

guardian, or guardian ad litem if such disclosure would materially
harm the treatment and rehabilitation of the child or would
substantially decrease the likelihood of receiving information from
the same or similar sources in the future.

on probation outside the child's home may be made under this section
unless the court or jury finds that the child, in the child's home,

child on probation on such reasonable and lawful terms as the court
may determine:
(A) in the child's own home or in the custody of a
relative or other fit person; or
(B) subject to the finding under Subsection (c) on the
placement of the child outside the child's home, in:
(i) a suitable foster home;
(ii) a suitable public or private residential
treatment facility licensed by a state governmental entity or
exempted from licensure by state law, except a facility operated by
the Texas Juvenile Justice Department; or
(iii) a suitable public or private postadjudication secure correctional facility that meets the requirements
of Section 51.125, except a facility operated by the Texas Juvenile
Justice Department;
(2) if the court or jury found at the conclusion of the
adjudication hearing that the child engaged in delinquent conduct
that violates a penal law of this state or the United States of the
grade of felony, the court or jury made a special commitment finding
under Section 54.04013, and the petition was not approved by the
grand jury under Section 53.045, the court may commit the child to

post-adjudication secure correctional facility under Section
54.04011(c)(1), as applicable, without a determinate sentence;
(3) if the court or jury found at the conclusion of the
adjudication hearing that the child engaged in delinquent conduct
that included a violation of a penal law listed in Section 53.045(a)
and if the petition was approved by the grand jury under Section
53.045, the court or jury may sentence the child to commitment in the
Texas Juvenile Justice Department or a post-adjudication secure

(iii) an aggravated controlled substance felony;
(B) not more than 20 years if the conduct constitutes a
felony of the second degree; or

felony of the third degree;
(4) the court may assign the child an appropriate sanction
level and sanctions as provided by the assignment guidelines in

(5) the court may place the child in a suitable nonsecure
correctional facility that is registered and meets the applicable
standards for the facility as provided by Section 51.126; or
(6) if applicable, the court or jury may make a disposition
under Subsection (m) or Section 54.04011(c)(2)(A).
(e) The Texas Juvenile Justice Department shall accept a person
properly committed to it by a juvenile court even though the person
may be 17 years of age or older at the time of commitment.
(f) The court shall state specifically in the order its reasons
for the disposition and shall furnish a copy of the order to the
child. If the child is placed on probation, the terms of probation

(g) If the court orders a disposition under Subsection (d)(3)
or (m) and there is an affirmative finding that the defendant used or

finding that the deadly weapon was a firearm, the court shall enter
that finding in the order.

outside the child's home;
(B) reasonable efforts were made to prevent or
eliminate the need for the child's removal from the home and to make
it possible for the child to return to the child's home; and
(C) the child, in the child's home, cannot be provided
the quality of care and level of support and supervision that the
child needs to meet the conditions of probation; and
(2) may approve an administrative body to conduct
permanency hearings pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 675 if required
during the placement or commitment of the child.
(j) If the court or jury found that the child engaged in
delinquent conduct that included a violation of a penal law of the
grade of felony or jailable misdemeanor, the court:
(1) shall require that the child's thumbprint be affixed or
attached to the order; and
(2) may require that a photograph of the child be attached
to the order.
(k) Except as provided by Subsection (m), the period to which a
court or jury may sentence a person to commitment to the Texas
Juvenile Justice Department with a transfer to the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice under Subsection (d)(3) applies without regard to
whether the person has previously been adjudicated as having engaged
in delinquent conduct.
(l) Except as provided by Subsection (q), a court or jury may
place a child on probation under Subsection (d)(1) for any period,
except that probation may not continue on or after the child's 18th

Section 53.045 alleging that the child engaged in habitual felony
conduct; and
(2) the court or jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that
the allegation described by Subdivision (1) in the grand jury
petition is true.
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 309 -
(n) A court may order a disposition of secure confinement of a
status offender adjudicated for violating a valid court order only
if:
(1) before the order is issued, the child received the full
due process rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United
States or the Texas Constitution; and
(2) the juvenile probation department in a report
authorized by Subsection (b):
(A) reviewed the behavior of the child and the
circumstances under which the child was brought before the court;
(B) determined the reasons for the behavior that caused
the child to be brought before the court; and
(C) determined that all dispositions, including
treatment, other than placement in a secure detention facility or
secure correctional facility, have been exhausted or are clearly
inappropriate.
(o) In a disposition under this title:
(1) a status offender may not, under any circumstances, be
committed to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department for engaging in
conduct that would not, under state or local law, be a crime if
committed by an adult;

probation period of two years.
(q) If a court or jury sentences a child to commitment in the
Texas Juvenile Justice Department or a post-adjudication secure
correctional facility under Subsection (d)(3) for a term of not more

under Subsection (d)(1) as an alternative to making the disposition
under Subsection (d)(3). The court shall prescribe the period of
probation ordered under this subsection for a term of not more than
10 years. The court may, before the sentence of probation expires,
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 310 -
extend the probationary period under Section 54.05, except that the
sentence of probation and any extension may not exceed 10 years. The
court may, before the child's 19th birthday, discharge the child from
the sentence of probation. If a sentence of probation ordered under
this subsection and any extension of probation ordered under Section
54.05 will continue after the child's 19th birthday, the court shall
discharge the child from the sentence of probation on the child's
19th birthday unless the court transfers the child to an appropriate
district court under Section 54.051.
(r) If the judge orders a disposition under this section and
there is an affirmative finding that the victim or intended victim
was younger than 17 years of age at the time of the conduct, the

(u) For the purposes of disposition under Subsection (d)(2),
delinquent conduct that violates a penal law of this state of the
grade of felony does not include conduct that violates a lawful order
of a county, municipal, justice, or juvenile court under
circumstances that would constitute contempt of that court.
(v) If the judge orders a disposition under this section for
delinquent conduct based on a violation of an offense, on the motion
of the attorney representing the state the judge shall make an
affirmative finding of fact and enter the affirmative finding in the
papers in the case if the judge determines that, regardless of
whether the conduct at issue is the subject of the prosecution or
part of the same criminal episode as the conduct that is the subject
of the prosecution, a victim in the trial:
(1) is or has been a victim of a severe form of trafficking
in persons, as defined by 22 U.S.C. Section 7102(8); or
(2) has suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a
result of having been a victim of criminal activity described by 8
U.S.C. Section 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii).
(w) That part of the papers in the case containing an
affirmative finding under Subsection (v):

facility following disposition of the child's case under Subsection

involving a child for whom the Department of Family and Protective
Services has been appointed managing conservator may communicate with
the court having continuing jurisdiction over the child before the
disposition hearing. The juvenile court may allow the parties to the
suit affecting the parent-child relationship in which the Department
of Family and Protective Services is a party to participate in the
communication under this subsection.
(z) Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit a
juvenile court or jury in a county to which Section 54.04011 applies
from committing a child to a post-adjudication secure correctional
facility in accordance with that section after a disposition hearing
held in accordance with this section.

by a wilful act or omission, contributed to, caused, or encouraged

or partial restitution to the victim of the offense. The program of

than actual damages under a juvenile court order.

of this section is entitled to a hearing on the order before the
order is entered by the court.

(B) violates a penal law of this state or the United
States, an element or elements of which involve a severe form of

under Chapter 524 or 724, Transportation Code, each of the

suspension under this section shall credit a period of suspension
imposed under Chapter 524 or 724, Transportation Code, toward the

birthday to discharge the child from the sentence of probation.
(d) If, after a hearing, the court determines to transfer the
child, the court shall transfer the child to an appropriate district

(e) A district court that exercises jurisdiction over a person
transferred under Subsection (d) shall place the person on community
supervision under Chapter 42A, Code of Criminal Procedure, for the
remainder of the person's probationary period and under conditions
consistent with those ordered by the juvenile court.
(e-1) The restrictions on a judge placing a defendant on
community supervision imposed by Article 42A.054, Code of Criminal
Procedure, do not apply to a case transferred from the juvenile
court. The minimum period of community supervision imposed by Article
42A.053(d), Code of Criminal Procedure, does not apply to a case
transferred from the juvenile court.
(e-2) If a person who is placed on community supervision under
this section violates a condition of that supervision or if the
person violated a condition of probation ordered under Section
54.04(q) and that probation violation was not discovered by the state
before the person's 19th birthday, the district court shall dispose
of the violation of community supervision or probation, as
appropriate, in the same manner as if the court had originally
exercised jurisdiction over the case. If the judge revokes community
supervision, the judge may reduce the prison sentence to any length
without regard to the minimum term imposed by Article 42A.755(a),
Code of Criminal Procedure.
(e-3) The time that a person serves on probation ordered under
Section 54.04(q) is the same as time served on community supervision
ordered under this section for purposes of determining the person's
eligibility for early discharge from community supervision under
Article 42A.701, Code of Criminal Procedure.

offense for which registration as a sex offender is required by
Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure, and defers the registration
requirement until completion of treatment for the sex offense under
Subchapter H, Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure, the authority
under that article to reexamine the need for registration on
completion of treatment is transferred to the court to which
probation is transferred.
(h) If the juvenile court places the child on probation for an
offense for which registration as a sex offender is required by
Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure, and the child registers, the
authority of the court to excuse further compliance with the
registration requirement under Subchapter H, Chapter 62, Code of
Criminal Procedure, is transferred to the court to which probation is
transferred.
(i) If the juvenile court exercises jurisdiction over a person
who is 18 or 19 years of age or older, as applicable, under Section
51.041 or 51.0412, the court or jury may, if the person is otherwise
eligible, place the person on probation under Section 54.04(q). The
juvenile court shall set the conditions of probation and immediately
transfer supervision of the person to the appropriate court
exercising criminal jurisdiction under Subsection (e).

sentence agree to the disposition of the case, wholly or partly, a
referee or associate judge may hold a hearing for the purpose of
allowing the child to enter a plea or stipulation of evidence. After
the hearing under this subsection, the referee or associate judge
shall transmit the referee's or associate judge's written findings
and recommendations regarding the plea or stipulation of evidence to

SUBCHAPTER C. CHILD UNFIT TO PROCEED AS A RESULT OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
Sec. 55.31. UNFITNESS TO PROCEED DETERMINATION; EXAMINATION.
(a) A child alleged by petition or found to have engaged in
delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision who
as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability lacks
capacity to understand the proceedings in juvenile court or to assist
in the child's own defense is unfit to proceed and shall not be
subjected to discretionary transfer to criminal court, adjudication,
disposition, or modification of disposition as long as such
incapacity endures.
(b) On a motion by a party, the juvenile court shall determine
whether probable cause exists to believe that a child who is alleged
by petition or who is found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or
conduct indicating a need for supervision is unfit to proceed as a
result of mental illness or an intellectual disability. In making its
determination, the court may:
(1) consider the motion, supporting documents, professional
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 358 -
statements of counsel, and witness testimony; and
(2) make its own observation of the child.
(c) If the court determines that probable cause exists to
believe that the child is unfit to proceed, the court shall
temporarily stay the juvenile court proceedings and immediately order
the child to be examined under Section 55.04.
(d) During an examination ordered under this section, and in
any report based on that examination, an expert shall consider, in
addition to other issues determined relevant by the expert:
(1) whether the child, as supported by current indications
and the child's personal history:
(A) is a child with mental illness; or
(B) is a child with an intellectual disability;
(2) the child's capacity to:
(A) appreciate the allegations against the child;
(B) appreciate the range and nature of allowable
dispositions that may be imposed in the proceedings against the
child;
(C) understand the roles of the participants and the
adversarial nature of the legal process;
(D) display appropriate courtroom behavior; and
(E) testify relevantly; and
(3) the degree of impairment resulting from the child's
mental illness or intellectual disability and the specific impact on
the child's capacity to engage with counsel in a reasonable and
rational manner.
(e) An expert's report to the court must state an opinion on
the child's fitness to proceed or explain why the expert is unable to
state that opinion and include:
(1) the child's history and current status regarding any
possible mental illness or intellectual disability;
(2) the child's developmental history as it relates to any
possible mental illness or intellectual disability;
(3) the child's functional abilities related to fitness to
stand trial;
(4) the relationship between deficits in the child's
functional abilities related to fitness to proceed and any mental
illness or intellectual disability; and
(5) if the expert believes the child is in need of
remediation or restoration services, a discussion of:
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 359 -
(A) whether the child's abilities are likely to be
remediated or restored within the period described by Section
55.33(a)(1), (2), or (3);
(B) whether the child may be adequately treated in an
alternative setting;
(C) any recommended interventions to aid in the
remediation or restoration of the child's fitness;
(D) whether the child meets criteria for court-ordered
treatment or services under Section 55.05 or 55.06; and
(E) if applicable, the specific criteria the child
meets under Paragraph (D).
(f) After considering all relevant information, including
information obtained from an examination under Section 55.04, the
court shall:
(1) if the court determines that evidence exists to support
a finding that the child is unfit to proceed, proceed under Section
55.32; or
(2) if the court determines that evidence does not exist to
support a finding that the child is unfit to proceed, dissolve the
stay and continue the juvenile court proceedings.

CHAPTER 56. APPEAL
Sec. 56.01. RIGHT TO APPEAL. (a) Except as provided by
Subsection (b-1), an appeal from an order of a juvenile court is to a
court of appeals and the case may be carried to the Texas Supreme
Court by writ of error or upon certificate, as in civil cases
generally.
(b) The requirements governing an appeal are as in civil cases
generally. When an appeal is sought by filing a notice of appeal,
security for costs of appeal, or an affidavit of inability to pay the
costs of appeal, and the filing is made in a timely fashion after the
date the disposition order is signed, the appeal must include the
juvenile court adjudication and all rulings contributing to that
adjudication. An appeal of the adjudication may be sought
notwithstanding that the adjudication order was signed more than 30
days before the date the notice of appeal, security for costs of
appeal, or affidavit of inability to pay the costs of appeal was
filed.
(b-1) A motion for new trial seeking to vacate an adjudication
is:
(1) timely if the motion is filed not later than the 30th
day after the date on which the disposition order is signed; and
(2) governed by Rule 21, Texas Rules of Appellate
Procedure.
(c) An appeal may be taken:
(1) except as provided by Subsection (n), by or on behalf
of a child from an order entered under:
(A) Section 54.02 respecting transfer of the child for
prosecution as an adult;
(B) Section 54.03 with regard to delinquent conduct or
conduct indicating a need for supervision;
(C) Section 54.04 disposing of the case;
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 381 -
(D) Section 54.05 respecting modification of a previous
juvenile court disposition; or
(E) Chapter 55 by a juvenile court committing a child
to a facility for persons with mental illness or intellectual
disabilities; or
(2) by a person from an order entered under Section
54.11(i)(2) transferring the person to the custody of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice.
(d) A child has the right to:
(1) appeal, as provided by this subchapter;
(2) representation by counsel on appeal; and
(3) appointment of an attorney for the appeal if an
attorney cannot be obtained because of indigency.
(e) On entering an order that is appealable under this section,
the court shall advise the child and the child's parent, guardian, or
guardian ad litem of the child's rights listed under Subsection (d)
of this section.
(f) If the child and his parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem
express a desire to appeal, the attorney who represented the child
before the juvenile court shall file a notice of appeal with the
juvenile court and inform the court whether that attorney will handle
the appeal. Counsel shall be appointed under the standards provided
in Section 51.10 of this code unless the right to appeal is waived in
accordance with Section 51.09 of this code.
(g) An appeal does not suspend the order of the juvenile court,
nor does it release the child from the custody of that court or of
the person, institution, or agency to whose care the child is
committed, unless the juvenile court so orders. However, the
appellate court may provide for a personal bond.
(g-1) An appeal from an order entered under Section 54.02
respecting transfer of the child for prosecution as an adult does not
stay the criminal proceedings pending the disposition of that appeal.
(h) If the order appealed from takes custody of the child from
the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or waives jurisdiction
under Section 54.02 and transfers the child to criminal court for
prosecution, the appeal has precedence over all other cases.
(h-1) The supreme court shall adopt rules accelerating the
disposition by the appellate court and the supreme court of an appeal
of an order waiving jurisdiction under Section 54.02 and transferring
a child to criminal court for prosecution.
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 382 -
(i) The appellate court may affirm, reverse, or modify the
judgment or order, including an order of disposition or modified
disposition, from which appeal was taken. It may reverse or modify
an order of disposition or modified order of disposition while
affirming the juvenile court adjudication that the child engaged in
delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision. It
may remand an order that it reverses or modifies for further
proceedings by the juvenile court.
(j) Neither the child nor his family shall be identified in an
appellate opinion rendered in an appeal or habeas corpus proceedings
related to juvenile court proceedings under this title. The
appellate opinion shall be styled, "In the matter of ..........,"
identifying the child by his initials only.
(k) The appellate court shall dismiss an appeal on the state's
motion, supported by affidavit showing that the appellant has escaped
from custody pending the appeal and, to the affiant's knowledge, has
not voluntarily returned to the state's custody on or before the 10th
day after the date of the escape. The court may not dismiss an
appeal, or if the appeal has been dismissed, shall reinstate the
appeal, on the filing of an affidavit of an officer or other credible
person showing that the appellant voluntarily returned to custody on
or before the 10th day after the date of the escape.
(l) Repealed by Acts 2023, 88th Leg., R.S., Ch. 256 (S.B. 1612
), Sec. 27(a)(8), eff. September 1, 2023.
(m) For purposes of determining indigency of the child under
this section, the court shall consider the assets and income of the
child, the child's parent, and any other person responsible for the
support of the child.
(n) A child who enters a plea or agrees to a stipulation of
evidence in a proceeding held under this title may not appeal an
order of the juvenile court entered under Section 54.03, 54.04, or
54.05 if the court makes a disposition in accordance with the
agreement between the state and the child regarding the disposition
of the case, unless:
(1) the court gives the child permission to appeal; or
(2) the appeal is based on a matter raised by written
motion filed before the proceeding in which the child entered the
plea or agreed to the stipulation of evidence.
(o) This section does not limit a child's right to obtain a
writ of habeas corpus.

CHAPTER 59. PROGRESSIVE SANCTIONS MODEL
Sec. 59.001. PURPOSES. The purposes of the progressive
sanctions model are to:
(1) ensure that juvenile offenders face uniform and
consistent consequences and punishments that correspond to the
seriousness of each offender's current offense, prior delinquent
history, special treatment or training needs, and effectiveness of
prior interventions;
(2) balance public protection and rehabilitation while
holding juvenile offenders accountable;
(3) permit flexibility in the decisions made in relation to
the juvenile offender to the extent allowed by law;
(4) consider the juvenile offender's circumstances;
(5) recognize that departure of a disposition from this
model is not necessarily undesirable and in some cases is highly
desirable; and
(6) improve juvenile justice planning and resource
allocation by ensuring uniform and consistent reporting of
disposition decisions at all levels.

Sec. 60.010. INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE
The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that
each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of
juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or
parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision
and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the
safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each
state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run
away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence.
The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the
Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and
encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in
the prevention of crime.
It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and
cooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) ensure that
the juveniles who are moved under this compact to another state for
probation or parole supervision and services are governed in the
receiving state by the same standards that apply to juveniles
receiving such supervision and services in the receiving state; (B)
ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 459 -
the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving
states are adequately protected and balanced with the juvenile's and
the juvenile's family's best interests and welfare when an interstate
movement is under consideration; (C) return juveniles who have run
away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been

a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators,
state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult
Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact for the Placement of
Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and
crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the Interstate

Interstate Commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of the

call additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all

committee, which shall include commission officers, members, and
others as determined by the bylaws. The executive committee shall

second anniversary of the date the order was issued.
(a-1) The court may render a protective order sufficient to
protect the applicant and members of the applicant's family or
household that is effective for a period that exceeds two years if
the court finds that the person who is the subject of the protective
order:
(1) committed an act constituting a felony offense
involving family violence against the applicant or a member of the
applicant's family or household, regardless of whether the person has
been charged with or convicted of the offense;
(2) caused serious bodily injury to the applicant or a
member of the applicant's family or household; or
(3) was the subject of two or more previous protective

estoppel for any criminal proceeding. The court may impose on a
party found to have made a false allegation of child abuse or neglect
any civil sanction permitted under law, including attorney's fees,

the laws of this state to any other child born alive after the normal
gestation period.
(b) In this code, "born alive" means the complete expulsion or

alive.

relationship is established between a child born alive after an
abortion and the physician who performed or attempted to perform the
abortion. The physician must exercise the same degree of
professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and
health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious
physician would render to any other child born alive at the same
gestational age. In this subsection, "professional skill, care, and

attempted the abortion ensure that the child born alive be
immediately transferred to a hospital.

penalty, the attorney general may recover reasonable attorney's fees.
The civil penalty described in this subsection is in addition to any
other recovery authorized under other law.

section shall report to the attorney general. The identity and any

Subsection (c) by failing to provide the appropriate medical
treatment to a child born alive after an abortion or an attempted

of the other state because a court of this state is a more convenient
forum under Section 152.207.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 152.204, a court of
this state, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall examine
the court documents and other information supplied by the parties

(b) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a
court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a
court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose,

consider all relevant factors, including:
(1) whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to
continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties
and the child;

state;

considers just and proper.

Upon the filing of a petition seeking enforcement of a child custody
determination, the petitioner may file a verified application for the
issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the
child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be
removed from this state.
(b) If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other
witness, finds that the child is imminently likely to suffer serious
physical harm or be removed from this state, it may issue a warrant
to take physical custody of the child. The petition must be heard on
the next judicial day after the warrant is executed unless that date
is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on
the first judicial day possible. The application for the warrant
must include the statements required by Section 152.308(b).
(c) A warrant to take physical custody of a child must:
(1) recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent
serious physical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is based;
(2) direct law enforcement officers to take physical
custody of the child immediately;

the child made under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of
International Child Abduction, the court may place a child with a
parent or family member in accordance with Subsection (c)(4) only if
the parent or family member has significant ties to the jurisdiction
of the court. If a parent or family member of the child does not

have significant ties to the jurisdiction of the court, the court
shall provide for the delivery of the child to the Department of

(d) The respondent must be served with the petition, warrant,
and order immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
(e) A warrant to take physical custody of a child is
enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds on the basis
of the testimony of the petitioner or other witness that a less
intrusive remedy is not effective, it may authorize law enforcement
officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the
child. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court
may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at
any hour.

Sec. 153.003. NO DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX OR MARITAL STATUS.
The court shall consider the qualifications of the parties without
regard to their marital status or to the sex of the party or the
child in determining:
(1) which party to appoint as sole managing conservator;
(2) whether to appoint a party as joint managing
conservator; and
(3) the terms and conditions of conservatorship and
possession of and access to the child.
Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff. April 20, 1995.
Sec. 153.004. HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL ABUSE.
(a) In determining whether to appoint a party as a sole or joint
managing conservator, the court shall consider evidence of the
intentional use of abusive physical force, or evidence of sexual
abuse, by a party directed against the party's spouse, a parent of
the child, or any person younger than 18 years of age committed
within a two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during
the pendency of the suit.
(b) The court may not appoint joint managing conservators if
credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or
present child neglect, or physical or sexual abuse by one parent
directed against the other parent, a spouse, or a child, including a
sexual assault in violation of Section 22.011 or 22.021, Penal Code,
that results in the other parent becoming pregnant with the child. A
history of sexual abuse includes a sexual assault that results in the
other parent becoming pregnant with the child, regardless of the
prior relationship of the parents. It is a rebuttable presumption
that the appointment of a parent as the sole managing conservator of
a child or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to
determine the primary residence of a child is not in the best
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 725 -
interest of the child if credible evidence is presented of a history
or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual
abuse by that parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or
a child.
(c) The court shall consider the commission of family violence
or sexual abuse in determining whether to deny, restrict, or limit
the possession of a child by a parent who is appointed as a
possessory conservator.
(d) The court may not allow a parent to have access to a child
for whom it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that:
(1) there is a history or pattern of committing family
violence during the two years preceding the date of the filing of the
suit or during the pendency of the suit; or
(2) the parent engaged in conduct that constitutes an
offense under Section 21.02, 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal Code,
and that as a direct result of the conduct, the victim of the conduct
became pregnant with the parent's child.
(d-1) Notwithstanding Subsection (d), the court may allow a
parent to have access to a child if the court:
(1) finds that awarding the parent access to the child
would not endanger the child's physical health or emotional welfare
and would be in the best interest of the child; and
(2) renders a possession order that is designed to protect
the safety and well-being of the child and any other person who has
been a victim of family violence committed by the parent and that may
include a requirement that:
(A) the periods of access be continuously supervised by
an entity or person chosen by the court;
(B) the exchange of possession of the child occur in a
protective setting;
(C) the parent abstain from the consumption of alcohol
or a controlled substance, as defined by Chapter 481, Health and
Safety Code, within 12 hours prior to or during the period of access
to the child; or
(D) the parent attend and complete a battering
intervention and prevention program as provided by Article 42.141,
Code of Criminal Procedure, or, if such a program is not available,
complete a course of treatment under Section 153.010.
(e) It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best
interest of a child for a parent to have unsupervised visitation with
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 726 -
the child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern
of past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by:
(1) that parent; or
(2) any person who resides in that parent's household or
who is permitted by that parent to have unsupervised access to the
child during that parent's periods of possession of or access to the
child.
(f) In determining under this section whether there is credible
evidence of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect or
abuse or family violence by a parent or other person, as applicable,
the court shall consider whether a protective order was rendered
under Chapter 85, Title 4, against the parent or other person during
the two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the
pendency of the suit.
(g) In this section:
(1) "Abuse" and "neglect" have the meanings assigned by
Section 261.001.
(2) "Family violence" has the meaning assigned by Section
71.004.

Sec. 153.0071. ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES. (a)
On written agreement of the parties, the court may refer a suit
affecting the parent-child relationship to arbitration. The
agreement must state whether the arbitration is binding or nonbinding.
(b) If the parties agree to binding arbitration, the court
shall render an order reflecting the arbitrator's award unless the
court determines at a non-jury hearing that the award is not in the
best interest of the child. The burden of proof at a hearing under
this subsection is on the party seeking to avoid rendition of an
order based on the arbitrator's award.
(c) On the written agreement of the parties or on the court's
own motion, the court may refer a suit affecting the parent-child
relationship to mediation.
(d) A mediated settlement agreement is binding on the parties
if the agreement:
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 729 -
(1) provides, in a prominently displayed statement that is
in boldfaced type or capital letters or underlined, that the
agreement is not subject to revocation;
(2) is signed by each party to the agreement; and
(3) is signed by the party's attorney, if any, who is
present at the time the agreement is signed.
(e) If a mediated settlement agreement meets the requirements
of Subsection (d), a party is entitled to judgment on the mediated
settlement agreement notwithstanding Rule 11, Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, or another rule of law.
(e-1) Notwithstanding Subsections (d) and (e), a court may
decline to enter a judgment on a mediated settlement agreement if the
court finds:
(1) that:
(A) a party to the agreement was a victim of family
violence, and that circumstance impaired the party's ability to make
decisions; or
(B) the agreement would permit a person who is subject
to registration under Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure, on the
basis of an offense committed by the person when the person was 17
years of age or older or who otherwise has a history or pattern of
past or present physical or sexual abuse directed against any person
to:
(i) reside in the same household as the child; or
(ii) otherwise have unsupervised access to the
child; and
(2) that the agreement is not in the child's best interest.
(f) A party may at any time prior to the final mediation order
file a written objection to the referral of a suit affecting the
parent-child relationship to mediation on the basis of family
violence having been committed by another party against the objecting
party or a child who is the subject of the suit. After an objection
is filed, the suit may not be referred to mediation unless, on the
request of a party, a hearing is held and the court finds that a
preponderance of the evidence does not support the objection. If the
suit is referred to mediation, the court shall order appropriate
measures be taken to ensure the physical and emotional safety of the
party who filed the objection. The order shall provide that the
parties not be required to have face-to-face contact and that the
parties be placed in separate rooms during mediation. This

containing the agreement to arbitrate is valid and enforceable

child where otherwise appropriate.
(e) In a suit in which the court's order contains provisions
related to a finding of family violence in the suit, including
supervised visitation, the court may award periods of electronic
communication under this section only if:
(1) the award and terms of the award are mutually agreed to

SUBCHAPTER I. PREVENTION OF INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION
Sec. 153.501. NECESSITY OF MEASURES TO PREVENT INTERNATIONAL

shall determine under this section whether it is necessary for the
court to take one or more of the measures described by Section
153.503 to protect the child from the risk of abduction by the
parent.
(b) In determining whether to take any of the measures
described by Section 153.503, the court shall consider:
(1) the public policies of this state described by Section
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 765 -
153.001(a) and the consideration of the best interest of the child
under Section 153.002;

parent of the child based on the court's evaluation of the risk
factors described by Section 153.502;

Sec. 153.502. ABDUCTION RISK FACTORS. (a) To determine
whether there is a risk of the international abduction of a child by
a parent of the child, the court shall consider evidence that the
parent:
(1) has taken, enticed away, kept, withheld, or concealed a
child in violation of another person's right of possession of or
access to the child, unless the parent presents evidence that the
parent believed in good faith that the parent's conduct was necessary
to avoid imminent harm to the child or the parent;
(2) has previously threatened to take, entice away, keep,
withhold, or conceal a child in violation of another person's right
of possession of or access to the child;
(3) lacks financial reason to stay in the United States,
including evidence that the parent is financially independent, is
able to work outside of the United States, or is unemployed;

facilitate the removal of the child from the United States by the
parent, including:

(D) closing bank accounts;
(E) liquidating other assets;
(F) hiding or destroying documents;

school or medical records;
(5) has a history of domestic violence that the court is
required to consider under Section 153.004; or
(6) has a criminal history or a history of violating court
orders.
(a-1) In considering evidence of planning activities under
Subsection (a)(4), the court also shall consider any evidence that
the parent was engaging in those activities as a part of a safety
plan to flee from family violence.
(b) If the court finds that there is credible evidence of a
risk of abduction of the child by a parent of the child based on the
court's consideration of the factors in Subsection (a), the court
shall also consider evidence regarding the following factors to
evaluate the risk of international abduction of the child by a
parent:
(1) whether the parent has strong familial, emotional, or
cultural ties to another country, particularly a country that is not
a signatory to or compliant with the Hague Convention on the Civil
Aspects of International Child Abduction; and
(2) whether the parent lacks strong ties to the United
States, regardless of whether the parent is a citizen or permanent
resident of the United States.
(c) If the court finds that there is credible evidence of a
risk of abduction of the child by a parent of the child based on the
court's consideration of the factors in Subsection (a), the court may
also consider evidence regarding the following factors to evaluate
the risk of international abduction of the child by a parent:

consider all relevant factors, including:
(1) the present value of the total amount of monthly

exceeds the amount of the unpaid child support obligation remaining
at the time of the obligor's death, the obligee shall hold the excess
amount as constructive trustee for the benefit of the deceased
obligor's estate until the obligee delivers the excess amount to the

provide for the support of the child in the event of the death of the

Sec. 154.125. APPLICATION OF GUIDELINES TO NET RESOURCES. (a)
The guidelines for the support of a child in this section are
specifically designed to apply to situations in which the obligor's
monthly net resources are not greater than the maximum amount of net
resources to which the statutory guidelines are applicable, as most
recently published by the Title IV-D agency in the Texas Register.
(a-1) The amount prescribed by Subsection (a) is adjusted every
six years as necessary to reflect inflation. The Title IV-D agency
shall compute the adjusted amount, to take effect beginning September
1 of the year of the adjustment, based on the percentage change in
the consumer price index during the 72-month period preceding March 1
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 812 -
of the year of the adjustment, as rounded to the nearest $50
increment. The Title IV-D agency shall publish the adjusted amount
in the Texas Register before September 1 of the year in which the
adjustment takes effect. For purposes of this subsection, "consumer
price index" has the meaning assigned by Section 341.201, Finance
Code.
(b) If the obligor's monthly net resources are not greater than
the amount described by Subsection (a) and the obligor's monthly net
resources are equal to or greater than the amount described by
Subsection (c), the court shall presumptively apply the following
schedule in rendering the child support order:
CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES
BASED ON THE MONTHLY NET RESOURCES OF THE OBLIGOR
1 child 20% of Obligor's Net Resources
2 children 25% of Obligor's Net Resources
3 children 30% of Obligor's Net Resources
4 children 35% of Obligor's Net Resources
5 children 40% of Obligor's Net Resources
6+ children Not less than the amount for 5 children
(c) If the obligor's monthly net resources are less than
$1,000, the court shall presumptively apply the following schedule in
rendering the child support order:
LOW-INCOME CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES

1 child 15% of Obligor's Net Resources
2 children 20% of Obligor's Net Resources

Sec. 154.126. APPLICATION OF GUIDELINES TO ADDITIONAL NET
RESOURCES. (a) If the obligor's net resources exceed the amount
provided by Section 154.125(a), the court shall presumptively apply
the percentage guidelines to the portion of the obligor's net
resources that does not exceed that amount. Without further
reference to the percentage recommended by these guidelines, the
court may order additional amounts of child support as appropriate,
depending on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the
child.
(b) The proper calculation of a child support order that
exceeds the presumptive amount established for the portion of the
obligor's net resources provided by Section 154.125(a) requires that
the entire amount of the presumptive award be subtracted from the
proven total needs of the child. After the presumptive award is
subtracted, the court shall allocate between the parties the
responsibility to meet the additional needs of the child according to
the circumstances of the parties. However, in no event may the
obligor be required to pay more child support than the greater of the
presumptive amount or the amount equal to 100 percent of the proven
needs of the child.

remaining child or children is in accordance with the child support
guidelines.
(b) A child support order is in compliance with the requirement
imposed by Subsection (a) if the order contains a provision that
specifies:
(1) the events, including a child reaching the age of 18
years or otherwise having the disabilities of minority removed, that
have the effect of terminating the obligor's obligation to pay child
support for that child; and

Sec. 154.128. COMPUTING SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN IN MORE THAN ONE
HOUSEHOLD. (a) In applying the child support guidelines for an
obligor who has children in more than one household, the court shall
apply the percentage guidelines in this subchapter by making the
following computation:
(1) determine the amount of child support that would be
ordered if all children whom the obligor has the legal duty to
support lived in one household by applying the schedule in this
subchapter;
(2) compute a child support credit for the obligor's
children who are not before the court by dividing the amount
determined under Subdivision (1) by the total number of children whom
the obligor is obligated to support and multiplying that number by
the number of the obligor's children who are not before the court;
(3) determine the adjusted net resources of the obligor by
subtracting the child support credit computed under Subdivision (2)
from the net resources of the obligor; and
(4) determine the child support amount for the children
before the court by applying the percentage guidelines for one
household for the number of children of the obligor before the court
to the obligor's adjusted net resources.
(b) For the purpose of determining a child support credit, the
total number of an obligor's children includes the children before
the court for the establishment or modification of a support order
and any other children, including children residing with the obligor,
whom the obligor has the legal duty of support.
(c) The child support credit with respect to children for whom
the obligor is obligated by an order to pay support is computed,
regardless of whether the obligor is delinquent in child support
payments, without regard to the amount of the order.

Sec. 154.131. RETROACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT. (a) The child
support guidelines are intended to guide the court in determining the
amount of retroactive child support, if any, to be ordered.
(b) In ordering retroactive child support, the court shall
consider the net resources of the obligor during the relevant time
period and whether:
(1) the mother of the child had made any previous attempts
to notify the obligor of his paternity or probable paternity;
(2) the obligor had knowledge of his paternity or probable
paternity;
(3) the order of retroactive child support will impose an
undue financial hardship on the obligor or the obligor's family; and
(4) the obligor has provided actual support or other
necessaries before the filing of the action.
(c) It is presumed that a court order limiting the amount of
retroactive child support to an amount that does not exceed the total
amount of support that would have been due for the four years
preceding the date the petition seeking support was filed is
reasonable and in the best interest of the child.
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 818 -
(d) The presumption created under this section may be rebutted
by evidence that the obligor:
(1) knew or should have known that the obligor was the
father of the child for whom support is sought; and
(2) sought to avoid the establishment of a support
obligation to the child.
(e) An order under this section limiting the amount of
retroactive support does not constitute a variance from the
guidelines requiring the court to make specific findings under
Section 154.130.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the
court retains jurisdiction to render an order for retroactive child
support in a suit if a petition requesting retroactive child support
is filed not later than the fourth anniversary of the date of the
child's 18th birthday.

obligor's disability, the court shall apply the guidelines by
determining the amount of child support that would be ordered under

amount of benefits or the value of the benefits paid to or for the
child as a result of the obligor's disability.

(A) the child is receiving medical assistance under
Chapter 32, Human Resources Code;
(B) the child is receiving health benefits coverage
under the state child health plan under Chapter 62, Health and Safety
Code, and the cost of any premium; and
(C) either parent has access to private health
insurance at reasonable cost to the obligor.
(c) In rendering temporary orders, the court shall, except for
good cause shown, order that any health insurance coverage in effect
for the child continue in effect pending the rendition of a final
order, except that the court may not require the continuation of any
health insurance that is not available to the parent at reasonable
cost to the obligor. If there is no health insurance coverage in

at a reasonable cost to the obligor, the court shall, except for good
cause shown, order health care coverage for the child as provided
under Section 154.182.
(d) On rendering a final order the court shall:
(1) make specific findings with respect to the manner in

court.
(e) In this section, "reasonable cost" means the cost of health
insurance coverage for a child that does not exceed nine percent of

if the obligor is responsible under a medical support order for the
cost of health insurance coverage for only one child. If the obligor
is responsible under a medical support order for the cost of health
insurance coverage for more than one child, "reasonable cost" means
the total cost of health insurance coverage for all children for
which the obligor is responsible under a medical support order that
does not exceed nine percent of the obligor's annual resources, as

Sec. 154.182. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR CHILD. (a) The court
shall consider the cost, accessibility, and quality of health
insurance coverage available to the parties and shall give priority
to health insurance coverage available through the employment of one
of the parties if the coverage is available at a reasonable cost to
the obligor.
(b) In determining the manner in which health care coverage for
the child is to be ordered, the court shall render its order in
accordance with the following priorities, unless a party shows good
cause why a particular order would not be in the best interest of the
child:
(1) if health insurance is available for the child through
a parent's employment or membership in a union, trade association, or
other organization at reasonable cost, the court shall order that
parent to include the child in the parent's health insurance;
(2) if health insurance is not available for the child
under Subdivision (1) but is available to a parent at reasonable cost
from another source, including the program under Section 154.1826 to
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 823 -
provide health insurance in Title IV-D cases, the court may order
that parent to provide health insurance for the child; or
(3) if health insurance coverage is not available for the
child under Subdivision (1) or (2), the court shall order the obligor
to pay the obligee, in addition to any amount ordered under the
guidelines for child support, an amount, not to exceed nine percent
of the obligor's annual resources, as described by Section
154.062(b), as cash medical support for the child.
(b-1) If the parent ordered to provide health insurance under
Subsection (b)(1) or (2) is the obligee, the court shall order the
obligor to pay the obligee, as additional child support, an amount
equal to the actual cost of health insurance for the child, but not
to exceed a reasonable cost to the obligor. In calculating the
actual cost of health insurance for the child, if the obligee has
other minor dependents covered under the same health insurance plan,
the court shall divide the total cost to the obligee for the
insurance by the total number of minor dependents, including the
child covered under the plan.
(b-2) If the court finds that neither parent has access to
private health insurance at a reasonable cost to the obligor, the
court shall order the parent awarded the exclusive right to designate
the child's primary residence or, to the extent permitted by law, the
other parent to apply immediately on behalf of the child for
participation in a government medical assistance program or health
plan. If the child participates in a government medical assistance
program or health plan, the court shall order cash medical support
under Subsection (b)(3).
(b-3) An order requiring the payment of cash medical support
under Subsection (b)(3) must allow the obligor to discontinue payment
of the cash medical support if:
(1) health insurance for the child becomes available to the
obligor at a reasonable cost; and
(2) the obligor:
(A) enrolls the child in the insurance plan; and
(B) provides the obligee and, in a Title IV-D case, the
Title IV-D agency, the information required under Section 154.185.
(c) In this section:
(1) "Accessibility" means the extent to which health

FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 825 -
accordance with the following priorities, unless a party shows good
cause why a particular order is not in the best interest of the
child:

a parent's employment or membership in a union, trade association, or

parent to include the child in the parent's dental insurance; or
(2) if dental insurance is not available for the child
under Subdivision (1) but is available to a parent from another
source and at a reasonable cost, the court may order that parent to
provide dental insurance for the child.
(d) If the parent ordered to provide dental insurance under
Subsection (c)(1) or (2) is the obligee, the court shall order the
obligor to pay the obligee, as additional child support, an amount
equal to the actual cost of dental insurance for the child, but not
to exceed a reasonable cost to the obligor. In calculating the
actual cost of dental insurance for the child, if the obligee has
other minor dependents covered under the same dental insurance plan,
the court shall divide the total cost to the obligee for the
insurance by the total number of minor dependents, including the
child covered under the plan.

(b) In consultation with the Texas Department of Insurance, the

and implement a statewide program to address the health care needs of
children in Title IV-D cases for whom health insurance is not
available to either parent at reasonable cost under Section
154.182(b)(1) or under Section 154.182(b)(2) from a source other than
the program.

children.
(e) The Title IV-D agency may use available private resources,

154.006. Enrollment of a child in the program does not preclude the
subsequent enrollment of the child in another health care plan that
becomes available to the child's parent at reasonable cost, including

(l) On or after the date specified in the notification required
by Subsection (k), a court that orders health care coverage for a
child in a Title IV-D case shall order that the child be enrolled in
the program authorized by this section unless other health insurance
is available for the child at reasonable cost, including the state
child health plan under Chapter 62, Health and Safety Code.
(m) Payment of premium costs for the enrollment of a child in
the program may be enforced by the Title IV-D agency against the
obligor by any means available for the enforcement of a child support
obligation, including income withholding under Chapter 158.
(n) The program is not subject to any provision of the
Insurance Code or other law that requires coverage or the offer of
coverage of a health care service or benefit.
(o) Any health information obtained by the program, or by a
third-party administrator providing program services, that is subject
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

adjudication with regard to the conservator, for an offense involving
the abuse of a child under Section 21.11, 22.011, or 22.021, Penal

sufficient to justify a temporary order and modification of an
existing court order or portion of a decree that provides for the
appointment of a conservator or that sets the terms and conditions of
conservatorship or for the possession of or access to a child.
(b) A person commits an offense if the person files a suit to

and substantial change of circumstances sufficient to justify a
temporary order and modification of an existing court order or

conservator or that sets the terms and conditions of conservatorship
or for the possession of or access to a child to conform the order to

constitute a material and substantial change of circumstances

possession of or access to a child except that the court may render a

Sec. 156.106. MODIFICATION OF ORDER BASED ON DEATH OF
CONSERVATOR. (a) The death of a person who is a conservator of a

existing court order or portion of a decree that provides for the
appointment of a conservator or that sets the terms and conditions of
conservatorship or for the possession of or access to the child.

SUBCHAPTER E. MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT
Sec. 156.401. GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT. (a)
Except as provided by Subsection (a-1), (a-2), or (b), the court may
modify an order that provides for the support of a child, including
an order for health care coverage under Section 154.182 or an order
for dental care coverage under Section 154.1825, if:
(1) the circumstances of the child or a person affected by
the order have materially and substantially changed since the earlier
of:
(A) the date of the order's rendition; or
(B) the date of the signing of a mediated or
collaborative law settlement agreement on which the order is based;
or
(2) it has been three years since the order was rendered or
last modified and the monthly amount of the child support award under
the order differs by either 20 percent or $100 from the amount that
would be awarded in accordance with the child support guidelines.
(a-1) If the parties agree to an order under which the amount
of child support differs from the amount that would be awarded in
accordance with the child support guidelines, the court may modify
the order only if the circumstances of the child or a person affected
by the order have materially and substantially changed since the date
of the order's rendition.
(a-2) A court or administrative order for child support in a
Title IV-D case may be modified at any time, and without a showing of
material and substantial change in the circumstances of the child or
a person affected by the order, to provide for medical support or
dental support of the child if the order does not provide health care
coverage as required under Section 154.182 or dental care coverage as
required under Section 154.1825.
(b) Except as provided by Sections 231.1015, 231.1016, and
231.1017, a support order may be modified with regard to the amount
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 864 -
of support ordered only as to obligations accruing after the earlier
of:
(1) the date of service of citation; or
(2) an appearance in the suit to modify.
(c) An order of joint conservatorship, in and of itself, does
not constitute grounds for modifying a support order.
(c-1) Incarceration of a child support obligor in a local,
state, or federal jail or prison for a period exceeding 180 days is a
material and substantial change of circumstances for the purposes of
this section.
(d) Release of a child support obligor from incarceration is a
material and substantial change in circumstances for purposes of this
section if the obligor's child support obligation was abated,
reduced, or suspended during the period of the obligor's
incarceration.

families under Chapter 154 to determine whether there has been a
material or substantial change of circumstances under this chapter
that warrants a modification of an existing child support order if
the modification is in the best interest of the child.
(b) If the amount of support contained in the order does not
substantially conform with the guidelines for single and multiple
families under Chapter 154, the court may modify the order to
substantially conform with the guidelines if the modification is in
the best interest of the child. A court may consider other relevant
evidence in addition to the factors listed in the guidelines.

requirements of the certificate of mailing prescribed by Section

obligor's affidavit by filing a contradicting affidavit in the manner
provided by Section 52.0012(e), Property Code.

described by Subsection (d), the issue of whether the real property
is subject to the lien must be resolved in an action brought for that
purpose in the district court of the county in which the real
property is located and the lien was filed.

individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of

obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls
under Subsection (b). The request may be filed with a registration
for enforcement or registration for modification under Subchapter G
or may be filed as a separate proceeding.

determination;
(2) the amount of prospective support, if any; and
(3) the total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued
interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are
credited as provided by Section 159.209.
(g) Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining which
order is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall
file a certified copy of the controlling order in each tribunal that

support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a
certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in

order, or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and

to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the
modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state, and the
order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
(c) A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a
child support order that may not be modified under the law of the
issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.
If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the
same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so
recognized under Section 159.207 establishes the aspects of the
support order that are nonmodifiable.
(d) In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of
the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling
order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The
obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that
order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a
tribunal of this state.
(e) On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state
modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal
of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive
jurisdiction.
(f) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) through (e) of this section
and Section 159.201(b), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction
to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:
(1) one party resides in another state; and
(2) the other party resides outside the United States.

state:
(1) may enforce the order that was modified only as to
arrears and interest accruing before the modification;

has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state's child
support order in a proceeding to register that order.
(b) A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this
section shall apply the provisions of Subchapters B and C, this

159.711, if a foreign country lacks or refuses to exercise
jurisdiction to modify its child support order pursuant to its laws,
a tribunal of this state may assume jurisdiction to modify the child
support order and bind all individuals subject to the personal
jurisdiction of the tribunal regardless of whether the consent to
modification of a child support order otherwise required of the
individual under Section 159.611 has been given or whether the
individual seeking modification is a resident of this state or of the

charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for

prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that, not less than 60 days
previously, the obligee had initiated proceedings for support under

this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the
governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in
that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child

may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether
a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective.

initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a
reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
(c) If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the
individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may
decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the

SUBCHAPTER F. GENETIC TESTING
Sec. 160.501. APPLICATION OF SUBCHAPTER. This subchapter
governs genetic testing of an individual to determine parentage,
regardless of whether the individual:
(1) voluntarily submits to testing; or
(2) is tested under an order of a court or a support
enforcement agency.
Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 821, Sec. 1.01, eff. June 14,
2001.
Sec. 160.502. ORDER FOR TESTING. (a) Except as otherwise
provided by this subchapter and by Subchapter G, a court shall order
a child and other designated individuals to submit to genetic testing
if the request is made by a party to a proceeding to determine
parentage.
(b) If a request for genetic testing of a child is made before
the birth of the child, the court or support enforcement agency may
not order in utero testing.
(c) If two or more men are subject to court-ordered genetic
testing, the testing may be ordered concurrently or sequentially.
Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 821, Sec. 1.01, eff. June 14,
2001.
Sec. 160.503. REQUIREMENTS FOR GENETIC TESTING. (a) Genetic
testing must be of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the
field of genetic testing. The testing must be performed in a testing
laboratory accredited by:
(1) the American Association of Blood Banks, or a successor
to its functions;
(2) the American Society for Histocompatibility and
Immunogenetics, or a successor to its functions; or
(3) an accrediting body designated by the federal secretary
of health and human services.
(b) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one or
more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal cells,
bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the
testing is not required to be of the same kind for each individual
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1018 -
undergoing genetic testing.
(c) Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual, the
testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select
frequencies for use in the calculation of the probability of
paternity of the individual. If there is disagreement as to the
testing laboratory's choice:
(1) the objecting individual may require the testing
laboratory, not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of
the report of the test, to recalculate the probability of paternity
using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the
laboratory;
(2) the individual objecting to the testing laboratory's
initial choice shall:
(A) if the frequencies are not available to the testing
laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the
requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting
bodies; or
(B) engage another testing laboratory to perform the
calculations; and
(3) the testing laboratory may use its own statistical
estimate if there is a question regarding which ethnic or racial
group is appropriate and, if available, shall calculate the
frequencies using statistics for any other ethnic or racial group
requested.
(d) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or racial
group, genetic testing does not rebuttably identify a man as the
father of a child under Section 160.505, an individual who has been
tested may be required to submit to additional genetic testing.
Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 821, Sec. 1.01, eff. June 14,
2001.
Sec. 160.504. REPORT OF GENETIC TESTING. (a) A report of the
results of genetic testing must be in a record and signed under
penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing laboratory. A report
made under the requirements of this subchapter is selfauthenticating.
(b) Documentation from the testing laboratory is sufficient to
establish a reliable chain of custody that allows the results of
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1019 -
genetic testing to be admissible without testimony if the
documentation includes:
(1) the name and photograph of each individual whose
specimens have been taken;

specimens;
(3) the places in which the specimens were collected and
the date of each collection;

Sec. 160.505. GENETIC TESTING RESULTS; REBUTTAL. (a) A man
is rebuttably identified as the father of a child under this chapter
if the genetic testing complies with this subchapter and the results
disclose:
(1) that the man has at least a 99 percent probability of
paternity, using a prior probability of 0.5, as calculated by using
the combined paternity index obtained in the testing; and
(2) a combined paternity index of at least 100 to 1.
(b) A man identified as the father of a child under Subsection
(a) may rebut the genetic testing results only by producing other
genetic testing satisfying the requirements of this subchapter that:
(1) excludes the man as a genetic father of the child; or
(2) identifies another man as the possible father of the
child.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by Section 160.510, if more
than one man is identified by genetic testing as the possible father
of the child, the court shall order each man to submit to further
genetic testing to identify the genetic father.

Sec. 160.507. ADDITIONAL GENETIC TESTING. The court or the
support enforcement agency shall order additional genetic testing on
the request of a party who contests the result of the original

not order additional testing unless the party provides advance
payment for the testing.
Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 821, Sec. 1.01, eff. June 14,
2001.
Sec. 160.508. GENETIC TESTING WHEN ALL INDIVIDUALS NOT
AVAILABLE. (a) Subject to Subsection (b), if a genetic testing
specimen for good cause and under circumstances the court considers
to be just is not available from a man who may be the father of a
child, a court may order the following individuals to submit
specimens for genetic testing:
(1) the parents of the man;
(2) any brothers or sisters of the man;
(3) any other children of the man and their mothers; and
(4) other relatives of the man necessary to complete
genetic testing.
(b) A court may not render an order under this section unless
the court finds that the need for genetic testing outweighs the
legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested.

the child.
(b) If each brother satisfies the requirements of Section
160.505 for being the identified father of the child and there is not
another identical brother being identified as the father of the
child, the court may rely on nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which
brother is the father of the child.

relationship between the child and the presumed father.
(b) In determining whether to deny a motion for an order for
genetic testing under this section, the court shall consider the best

(6) any harm that may result to the child if presumed
paternity is successfully disproved;
(7) the nature of the relationship between the child and
the alleged father;

chances of establishing the paternity of another man and a child
support obligation in favor of the child; and
(9) other factors that may affect the equities arising from
the disruption of the father-child relationship between the child and

the presumed father or the chance of other harm to the child.
(c) In a proceeding involving the application of this section,

amicus attorney or attorney ad litem.
(d) A denial of a motion for an order for genetic testing must

Sec. 161.005. TERMINATION WHEN PARENT IS PETITIONER. (a) A
parent may file a suit for termination of the petitioner's parentchild relationship. Except as provided by Subsection (h), the court
may order termination if termination is in the best interest of the
child.
(b) If the petition designates the Department of Family and
Protective Services as managing conservator, the department shall be
given service of citation. The court shall notify the department if
the court appoints the department as the managing conservator of the
child.
(c) Subject to Subsection (d), a man may file a suit for
termination of the parent-child relationship between the man and a
child if, without obtaining genetic testing, the man signed an
acknowledgment of paternity of the child in accordance with
Subchapter D, Chapter 160, or was adjudicated to be the father of the
child in a previous proceeding under this title in which genetic
testing did not occur. The petition must be verified and must allege
facts showing that the petitioner:
(1) is not the child's genetic father; and
(2) signed the acknowledgment of paternity or failed to
contest parentage in the previous proceeding because of the mistaken
belief, at the time the acknowledgment was signed or on the date the
court order in the previous proceeding was rendered, that he was the
child's genetic father based on misrepresentations that led him to
that conclusion.
(d) A man may not file a petition under Subsection (c) if:
(1) the man is the child's adoptive father;
(2) the child was conceived by assisted reproduction and
the man consented to assisted reproduction by his wife under
Subchapter H, Chapter 160; or
(3) the man is the intended father of the child under a
gestational agreement validated by a court under Subchapter I,
Chapter 160.
(e) A petition under Subsection (c) must be filed not later
than the second anniversary of the date on which the petitioner
becomes aware of the facts alleged in the petition indicating that
the petitioner is not the child's genetic father.
(f) In a proceeding initiated under Subsection (c), the court
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1055 -
shall hold a pretrial hearing to determine whether the petitioner has
established a meritorious prima facie case for termination of the
parent-child relationship. If a meritorious prima facie claim is
established, the court shall order the petitioner and the child to
submit to genetic testing under Subchapter F, Chapter 160.
(g) If the results of genetic testing ordered under Subsection
(f) identify the petitioner as the child's genetic father under the
standards prescribed by Section 160.505 and the results of any
further testing requested by the petitioner and ordered by the court
under Subchapter F, Chapter 160, do not exclude the petitioner as the
child's genetic father, the court shall deny the petitioner's request
for termination of the parent-child relationship.
(h) If the results of genetic testing ordered under Subsection
(f) exclude the petitioner as the child's genetic father, the court
shall render an order terminating the parent-child relationship.
(i) An order under Subsection (h) terminating the parent-child
relationship ends the petitioner's obligation for future support of
the child as of the date the order is rendered, as well as the
obligation to pay interest that accrues after that date on the basis
of a child support arrearage or money judgment for a child support
arrearage existing on that date. The order does not affect the
petitioner's obligations for support of the child incurred before
that date. Those obligations are enforceable until satisfied by any
means available for the enforcement of child support other than
contempt.
(j) An order under Subsection (h) terminating the parent-child
relationship does not preclude:
(1) the initiation of a proceeding under Chapter 160 to
adjudicate whether another man is the child's parent; or
(2) if the other man subject to a proceeding under
Subdivision (1) is adjudicated as the child's parent, the rendition
of an order requiring that man to pay child support for the child
under Chapter 154, subject to Subsection (k).
(k) Notwithstanding Section 154.131, an order described by
Subsection (j)(2) may not require the other man to pay retroactive
child support for any period preceding the date on which the order
under Subsection (h) terminated the parent-child relationship between
the child and the man seeking termination under this section.
(l) At any time before the court renders an order terminating
the parent-child relationship under Subsection (h), the petitioner
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1056 -
may request that the court also order periods of possession of or
access to the child by the petitioner following termination of the
parent-child relationship. If requested, the court may order periods
of possession of or access to the child only if the court determines
that denial of periods of possession of or access to the child would
significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional wellbeing.
(m) The court may include provisions in an order under
Subsection (l) that require:
(1) the child or any party to the proceeding to participate
in counseling with a mental health professional who:
(A) has a background in family therapy; and
(B) holds a professional license that requires the
person to possess at least a master's degree; and
(2) any party to pay the costs of the counseling described
by Subdivision (1).
(n) Notwithstanding Subsection (m)(1), if a person who
possesses the qualifications described by that subdivision is not
available in the county in which the court is located, the court may
require that the counseling be conducted by another person the court
considers qualified for that purpose.
(o) During any period of possession of or access to the child
ordered under Subsection (l) the petitioner has the rights and duties
specified by Section 153.074, subject to any limitation specified by
the court in its order.

(1) the parent has engaged in conduct that constitutes an
offense under Section 21.02, 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal Code;

parent's child; and
(3) termination is in the best interest of the child.
(b) If, for the two years after the birth of the child, the
parent was married to or cohabiting with the other parent of the
child, the court may order the termination of the parent-child
relationship of the parent and the child if the court finds that:
(1) the parent has been convicted of an offense committed
under Section 21.02, 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal Code;
(2) as a direct result of the commission of the offense by
the parent, the other parent became pregnant with the child; and

that:
(a) Each child requiring placement shall receive the
maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with
persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and
facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of
care.
(b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is
to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances
of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with
applicable requirements for the protection of the child.
(c) The proper authorities of the state from which the
placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the
basis on which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.
(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of
children will be promoted.
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
As used in this compact:
(a) "Child" means a person who, by reason of minority, is
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1094 -
legally subject to parental, guardianship, or similar control.
(b) "Sending agency" means a party state, officer, or
employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or
employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation,
association, charitable agency, or other entity which sends, brings,
or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.
(c) "Receiving state" means the state to which a child is
sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public
authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement
with state or local public authorities or for placement with private
agencies or persons.
(d) "Placement" means the arrangement for the care of a
child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency
or institution but does not include any institution caring for the
mentally ill, mentally defective, or epileptic or any institution
primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical
facility.
ARTICLE III. CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT
(a) No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or
brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster
care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending
agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this
article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing
the placement of children therein.
(b) Prior to sending, bringing, or causing any child to be sent
or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as
a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall
furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state
written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in
the receiving state. The notice shall contain:
(1) the name, date, and place of birth of the child;
(2) the identity and address or addresses of the parents or
legal guardian;

institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send,

FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1095 -
in receipt of a notice pursuant to Paragraph (b) of this article may
request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or
agency of or in the sending agency's state, and shall be entitled to
receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it
may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose
and policy of this compact.
(d) The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent
or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public
authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency,
in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear
to be contrary to the interests of the child.
ARTICLE IV. PENALTY FOR ILLEGAL PLACEMENT
The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any
receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact
shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of
children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or
from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state.
Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either
jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability
for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall
constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or
revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held
by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place or care
for children.
ARTICLE V. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION
(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child
sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody,
supervision, care, treatment, and disposition of the child which it
would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's
state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes selfsupporting, or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate
authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also
include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its
transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The
sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for
support and maintenance of the child during the period of the
placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of
jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of
delinquency or crime committed therein.
(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1096 -
into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the
receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services
in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending
agency.
(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a
private charitable agency authorized to place children in the
receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that
state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to
prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial
responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has
been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the
responsibility set forth in Paragraph (a) hereof.
ARTICLE VI. INSTITUTIONAL CARE OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN
A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution
in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such
placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on
notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior
to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional
care and the court finds that:
(1) equivalent facilities for the child are not available
in the sending agency's jurisdiction; and
(2) institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the
best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.
ARTICLE VII. COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR
The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact
shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of
activities under this compact in his jurisdiction and who, acting
jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions, shall have
power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more
effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.
ARTICLE VIII. LIMITATIONS
This compact shall not apply to:
(a) the sending or bringing of a child into a receiving
state by his parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or
sister, adult uncle or aunt, or his guardian and leaving the child
with any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state;
or
(b) any placement, sending, or bringing of a child into a
receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which
both the state from which the child is sent or brought and the
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1097 -
receiving state are party, or to any other agreement between said
states which has the force of law.
ARTICLE IX. ENACTMENT AND WITHDRAWAL
This compact shall be open to joinder by any state, territory,
or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of congress, the
government of Canada or any province thereof. It shall become
effective with respect to any such jurisdiction when such
jurisdiction has enacted the same into law. Withdrawal from this
compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same,
but shall not take effect until two years after the effective date of
such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been
given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other party
jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the
rights, duties, and obligations under this compact of any sending
agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to the
effective date of withdrawal.
ARTICLE X. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact
shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision
of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any
party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to
any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the
validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability
thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not
be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the
constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in
full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force
and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

SUBCHAPTER C. INTERSTATE COMPACT ON ADOPTION AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
Sec. 162.201. ADOPTION OF COMPACT; TEXT. The Interstate
Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance is adopted by this state
and entered into with all other jurisdictions joining in the compact
in form substantially as provided under this subchapter.
INTERSTATE COMPACT ON ADOPTION AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
ARTICLE I. FINDINGS
The legislature finds that:
(a) Finding adoptive families for children for whom state
assistance is desirable, under Subchapter D, Chapter 162, and
assuring the protection of the interest of the children affected
during the entire assistance period require special measures when the
adoptive parents move to other states or are residents of another
state.
(b) The provision of medical and other necessary services
for children, with state assistance, encounters special difficulties
when the provision of services takes place in other states.
The purposes of the compact are to:
(a) authorize the Department of Family and Protective
Services, with the concurrence of the Health and Human Services
Commission, to enter into interstate agreements with agencies of
other states for the protection of children on behalf of whom
adoption assistance is being provided by the Department of Family and
Protective Services; and
(b) provide procedures for interstate children's adoption
assistance payments, including medical payments.
In this compact:
(a) "Adoption assistance state" means the state that signs
an adoption assistance agreement in a particular case.
(b) "Residence state" means the state in which the child
resides by virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.
(c) "State" means a state of the United States, the
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a

by the United States.
The Department of Family and Protective Services, through its
commissioner, is authorized to develop, participate in the
development of, negotiate, and enter into one or more interstate
compacts on behalf of this state with other states to implement one
or more of the purposes of this compact. An interstate compact
authorized by this article has the force and effect of law.
A compact entered into under the authority conferred by this
compact shall contain:
(1) a provision making the compact available for joinder by
all states;
(2) a provision for withdrawal from the compact on written
notice to the parties, with a period of one year between the date of
the notice and the effective date of the withdrawal;
(3) a requirement that protections under the compact
continue for the duration of the adoption assistance and apply to all
children and their adoptive parents who on the effective date of the
withdrawal are receiving adoption assistance from a party state other
than the one in which they reside and have their principal place of
abode;
(4) a requirement that each case of adoption assistance to
which the compact applies be covered by a written adoption assistance
agreement between the adoptive parents and the state child welfare
agency of the state that provides the adoption assistance and that
the agreement be expressly for the benefit of the adopted child and
enforceable by the adoptive parents and the state agency providing
the adoption assistance; and
(5) other provisions that are appropriate for the proper
administration of the compact.
A compact entered into under the authority conferred by this
compact may contain the following provisions, in addition to those
required under Article V of this compact:
(1) provisions establishing procedures and entitlement to
medical, developmental, child-care, or other social services for the
child in accordance with applicable laws, even if the child and the

providing the services or the funds to defray part or all of the

costs thereof; and
(2) other provisions that are appropriate or incidental to
the proper administration of the compact.
(a) A child with special needs who resides in this state and
who is the subject of an adoption assistance agreement with another
state is entitled to receive a medical assistance identification from
this state on the filing in the state medical assistance agency of a
certified copy of the adoption assistance agreement obtained from the
adoption assistance state. In accordance with rules of the state
medical assistance agency, the adoptive parents, at least annually,
shall show that the agreement is still in effect or has been renewed.
(b) The state medical assistance agency shall consider the
holder of a medical assistance identification under this article as
any other holder of a medical assistance identification under the
laws of this state and shall process and make payment on claims on
the holder's account in the same manner and under the same conditions
and procedures as for other recipients of medical assistance.
(c) The state medical assistance agency shall provide coverage
and benefits for a child who is in another state and who is covered
by an adoption assistance agreement made by the Department of Family
and Protective Services for the coverage or benefits, if any, not
provided by the residence state. The adoptive parents acting for the
child may submit evidence of payment for services or benefit amounts
not payable in the residence state and shall be reimbursed for those
amounts. Services or benefit amounts covered under any insurance or
other third-party medical contract or arrangement held by the child
or the adoptive parents may not be reimbursed. The state medical
assistance agency shall adopt rules implementing this subsection.
The additional coverage and benefit amounts provided under this
subsection are for services for which there is no federal
contribution or services that, if federally aided, are not provided
by the residence state. The rules shall include procedures for
obtaining prior approval for services in cases in which prior
approval is required for the assistance.
(d) The submission of a false, misleading, or fraudulent claim
for payment or reimbursement for services or benefits under this
article or the making of a false, misleading, or fraudulent statement
in connection with the claim is an offense under this subsection if
the person submitting the claim or making the statement knows or
FAMILY CODE
ARTICLE VII. MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1103 -
should know that the claim or statement is false, misleading, or
fraudulent. A person who commits an offense under this subsection
may be liable for a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment for
not more than two years, or both the fine and the imprisonment. An
offense under this subsection that also constitutes an offense under
other law may be punished under either this subsection or the other
applicable law.
(e) This article applies only to medical assistance for
children under adoption assistance agreements with states that have
entered into a compact with this state under which the other state
provides medical assistance to children with special needs under
adoption assistance agreements made by this state. All other
children entitled to medical assistance under adoption assistance
agreements entered into by this state are eligible to receive the
medical assistance in accordance with the laws and procedures that
apply to the agreement.
Consistent with federal law, the Department of Family and
Protective Services and the Health and Human Services Commission, in
connection with the administration of this compact or a compact
authorized by this compact, shall include the provision of adoption
assistance and medical assistance for which the federal government
pays some or all of the cost in any state plan made under the
Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub. L. No. 96-
272), Titles IV-E and XIX of the Social Security Act, and other
applicable federal laws. The Department of Family and Protective
Services and the Health and Human Services Commission shall apply for
and administer all relevant federal aid in accordance with law.

(g) The commissioner of the department by rule shall provide
that the maximum amount of the subsidy under Subsection (b) that may
be paid to an adoptive parent of a child under an adoption assistance
agreement is an amount that is equal to the amount that would have
been paid to the foster parent of the child, based on the child's
foster care service level on the date the department and the adoptive
parent enter into the adoption assistance agreement. This subsection
applies only to a child who, based on factors specified in rules of
the department, the department determines would otherwise have been
expected to remain in foster care until the child's 18th birthday and
for whom this state would have made foster care payments for that
care. Factors the department may consider in determining whether a
child is eligible for the amount of the subsidy authorized by this
subsection include the following:
(1) the child's mental or physical disability, age, and
membership in a sibling group; and
(2) the number of prior placement disruptions the child has
experienced.
(h) In determining the amount that would have been paid to a
foster parent for purposes of Subsection (g), the department:
(1) shall use the minimum amount required to be paid to a
foster parent for a child assigned the same service level as the
child who is the subject of the adoption assistance agreement; and
(2) may not include any amount that a child-placing agency
is entitled to retain under the foster care rate structure in effect
on the date the department and the adoptive parent enter into the
agreement.
(i) A child for whom a subsidy is provided under Subsection (b1) for premiums for health benefits coverage and who does not receive
any other subsidy under this section is not considered to be the
subject of an adoption assistance agreement for any other purpose,
including for determining eligibility for the exemption from payment
of tuition and fees for higher education under Section 54.367,
Education Code.
(j) The department shall keep records necessary to evaluate the

shall process each registration in an attempt to match the adoptee
and the adoptee's birth parents or the adoptee and the adoptee's
biological siblings.
(b) The administrator shall determine that there is a match if
the adult adoptee and the birth mother or the birth father have
registered or if a biological sibling has registered.
(c) To establish or corroborate a match, the administrator
shall request confirmation of a possible match from the vital

records sufficient information through which the match may be
confirmed, the administrator may, but is not required to, request
confirmation from the vital statistics unit. The vital statistics
unit may confirm or deny the match without breaching the duty of
confidentiality to the adoptee, adoptive parents, birth parents, or
biological siblings and without a court order.

confirmation of a possible match from the agency, if any, that has
possession of records concerning the adoption of an adoptee or from
the court that granted the adoption, the hospital where the adoptee
or any biological sibling was born, the physician who delivered the
adoptee or biological sibling, or any other person who has knowledge
of the relevant facts. The agency, court, hospital, physician, or
person with knowledge may confirm or deny the match without breaching
any duty of confidentiality to the adoptee, adoptive parents, birth
parents, or biological siblings.
(e) If a match is denied by a source contacted under Subsection
(d), the administrator shall make a full and complete investigation
into the reliability of the denial. If the match is corroborated by
other reliable sources and the administrator is satisfied that the
denial is erroneous, the administrator may make disclosures but shall
report to the adoptee, birth parents, and biological siblings
involved that the match was not confirmed by all information sources.

unwilling to conduct a joint investigation under this section.
(h) The department and the appropriate local law enforcement
agency shall conduct an investigation, other than an investigation
under Subchapter E, as provided by this section and Article 2A.057,

described by this subsection, the department shall notify the
appropriate local law enforcement agency of the report.

shall designate employees to serve specifically as investigators and
responders for after-hours reports of child abuse or neglect.

Sec. 261.302. CONDUCT OF INVESTIGATION. (a) The investigation
may include:
(1) a visit to the child's home, unless the alleged abuse
or neglect can be confirmed or clearly ruled out without a home
visit; and
(2) an interview with and examination of the subject child,
which may include a medical, psychological, or psychiatric
examination.
(b) The interview with and examination of the child may:
(1) be conducted at any reasonable time and place,
including the child's home or the child's school;
(2) include the presence of persons the department
determines are necessary; and
(3) include transporting the child for purposes relating to
the interview or investigation.
(b-1) Before the department may transport a child as provided
by Subsection (b)(3), the department shall attempt to notify the
parent or other person having custody of the child of the transport.
(c) The investigation may include an interview with the child's
parents and an interview with and medical, psychological, or
psychiatric examination of any child in the home.
(d) If, before an investigation is completed, the investigating
agency believes that the immediate removal of a child from the

neglect, the investigating agency shall file a petition or take other
action under Chapter 262 to provide for the temporary care and
protection of the child.

(e) An interview with a child in which the allegations of the
current investigation are discussed and that is conducted by the
department during the investigation stage shall be audiotaped or
videotaped unless:
(1) the recording equipment malfunctions and the
malfunction is not the result of a failure to maintain the equipment
or bring adequate supplies for the equipment;
(2) the child is unwilling to allow the interview to be
recorded after the department makes a reasonable effort consistent
with the child's age and development and the circumstances of the
case to convince the child to allow the recording; or
(3) due to circumstances that could not have been
reasonably foreseen or prevented by the department, the department
does not have the necessary recording equipment because the
department employee conducting the interview does not ordinarily
conduct interviews.
(e-1) An interview with a child alleged to be a victim of
physical abuse or sexual abuse conducted by an investigating agency
other than the department shall be audiotaped or videotaped unless
the investigating agency determines that good cause exists for not
audiotaping or videotaping the interview in accordance with rules of
the agency. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, such
considerations as the age of the child and the nature and seriousness
of the allegations under investigation. Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed as prohibiting the investigating agency from
audiotaping or videotaping an interview of a child on any case for
which such audiotaping or videotaping is not required under this
subsection. The fact that the investigating agency failed to
audiotape or videotape an interview is admissible at the trial of the
offense that is the subject of the interview.
(f) A person commits an offense if the person is notified of
the time of the transport of a child by the department and the
location from which the transport is initiated and the person is
present at the location when the transport is initiated and attempts
to interfere with the department's investigation. An offense under
this subsection is a Class B misdemeanor. It is an exception to the
application of this subsection that the department requested the
person to be present at the site of the transport.

Sec. 262.1015. REMOVAL OF ALLEGED PERPETRATOR; OFFENSE. (a)
If the Department of Family and Protective Services determines after
an investigation that child abuse has occurred and that the child
would be protected in the child's home by the removal of the alleged
perpetrator of the abuse, the department shall file a petition for
the removal of the alleged perpetrator from the residence of the
child rather than attempt to remove the child from the residence.
(a-1) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if the Department of
Family and Protective Services determines that a protective order
issued under Title 4 provides a reasonable alternative to obtaining
an order under that subsection, the department may:
(1) file an application for a protective order on behalf of
the child instead of or in addition to obtaining a temporary
restraining order under this section; or
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1355 -
(2) assist a parent or other adult with whom a child
resides in obtaining a protective order.
(b) A court may issue a temporary restraining order in a suit
by the department for the removal of an alleged perpetrator under
Subsection (a) if the department's petition states facts sufficient
to satisfy the court that:
(1) there is an immediate danger to the physical health or
safety of the child or the child has been a victim of sexual abuse;
(2) there is no time, consistent with the physical health
or safety of the child, for an adversary hearing;
(3) the child is not in danger of abuse from a parent or
other adult with whom the child will continue to reside in the
residence of the child;
(4) the parent or other adult with whom the child will
continue to reside in the child's home is likely to:
(A) make a reasonable effort to monitor the residence;
and
(B) report to the department and the appropriate law
enforcement agency any attempt by the alleged perpetrator to return
to the residence; and
(5) the issuance of the order is in the best interest of
the child.
(c) The order shall be served on the alleged perpetrator and on
the parent or other adult with whom the child will continue to
reside.
(d) A temporary restraining order under this section expires
not later than the 14th day after the date the order was rendered,
unless the court grants an extension under Section 262.201(e).
(e) A temporary restraining order under this section and any
other order requiring the removal of an alleged perpetrator from the
residence of a child shall require that the parent or other adult
with whom the child will continue to reside in the child's home make
a reasonable effort to monitor the residence and report to the
department and the appropriate law enforcement agency any attempt by
the alleged perpetrator to return to the residence.
(f) The court shall order the removal of an alleged perpetrator
if the court finds that the child is not in danger of abuse from a
parent or other adult with whom the child will continue to reside in
the child's residence and that:
(1) the presence of the alleged perpetrator in the child's
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1356 -
residence constitutes a continuing danger to the physical health or
safety of the child; or
(2) the child has been the victim of sexual abuse and there
is a substantial risk that the child will be the victim of sexual
abuse in the future if the alleged perpetrator remains in the
residence.
(g) A person commits an offense if the person is a parent or
other person with whom a child resides, the person is served with an
order containing the requirement specified by Subsection (e), and the
person fails to make a reasonable effort to monitor the residence of
the child or to report to the department and the appropriate law
enforcement agency an attempt by the alleged perpetrator to return to
the residence. An offense under this section is a Class A
misdemeanor.
(h) A person commits an offense if, in violation of a court
order under this section, the person returns to the residence of the
child the person is alleged to have abused. An offense under this
subsection is a Class A misdemeanor, except that the offense is a
felony of the third degree if the person has previously been
convicted under this subsection.

Sec. 262.102. EMERGENCY ORDER AUTHORIZING POSSESSION OF CHILD.
(a) Before a court may, without prior notice and a hearing, issue a
temporary order for the conservatorship of a child under Section
105.001(a)(1) or a temporary restraining order or attachment of a
child authorizing a governmental entity to take possession of a child
in a suit brought by a governmental entity, the court must find that:
(1) there is an immediate danger to the physical health or
safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect or
sexual abuse;
(2) continuation in the home would be contrary to the
child's welfare;
(3) there is no time, consistent with the physical health
or safety of the child and the nature of the emergency, for a full
adversary hearing under Subchapter C;
(4) the child would not be adequately protected in the
child's home with an order for the removal of the alleged perpetrator
under Section 262.1015 or 262.1016 or a protective order issued under
Title 4;
(5) placing the child with a relative or designated
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1358 -
caregiver or with a caregiver under a parental child safety placement
agreement authorized by Subchapter L, Chapter 264:
(A) was offered but refused;
(B) was not possible because there was no time,
consistent with the physical health or safety of the child and the
nature of the emergency, to conduct the caregiver evaluation; or
(C) would pose an immediate danger to the physical
health or safety of the child; and
(6) reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances
and providing for the safety of the child, were made to prevent or
eliminate the need for removal of the child.
(b) In determining whether there is an immediate danger to the
physical health or safety of a child, the court may consider whether
the child's household includes a person who has:
(1) abused or neglected another child in a manner that
caused serious injury to or the death of the other child; or
(2) sexually abused another child.
(b-1) A determination under this section that there is an
immediate danger to the physical health or safety of a child or that
the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse may not be
based solely on the opinion of a medical professional under contract
with the Department of Family and Protective Services who did not
conduct a physical examination of the child.
(c) If, based on the recommendation of or a request by the
Department of Family and Protective Services, the court finds that
child abuse or neglect has occurred and that the child requires
protection from family violence by a member of the child's family or
household, the court shall render a temporary order under Title 4 for
the protection of the child. In this subsection, "family violence"
has the meaning assigned by Section 71.004.
(d) The temporary order, temporary restraining order, or
attachment of a child rendered by the court under Subsection (a) must
contain the following statement prominently displayed in boldface
type, capital letters, or underlined:
"YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY. IF YOU
ARE INDIGENT AND UNABLE TO AFFORD AN ATTORNEY, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
REQUEST THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ATTORNEY BY CONTACTING THE COURT AT

COURT MAY HEAR EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE INDIGENT. IF THE
COURT DETERMINES YOU ARE INDIGENT AND ELIGIBLE FOR APPOINTMENT OF AN

(e) The temporary order, temporary restraining order, or
attachment of a child rendered by the court under Subsection (a) must
describe with specificity in a separate section the reasonable
efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the
safety of the child, that were made to prevent or eliminate the need
for the removal of the child as required by Subsection (a)(4).

SUBCHAPTER C. ADVERSARY HEARING
Sec. 262.201. FULL ADVERSARY HEARING; FINDINGS OF THE COURT.
(a) In a suit filed under Section 262.101 or 262.105, unless the
child has already been returned to the parent, managing conservator,
possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian entitled to
possession and the temporary order, if any, has been dissolved, a
full adversary hearing shall be held not later than the 14th day
after the date the child was taken into possession by the
governmental entity, unless the court grants an extension under
Subsection (e) or (e-1).
(b) Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 8 (H.B. 567),
Sec. 13(3), eff. September 1, 2021.
(c) Before commencement of the full adversary hearing, the
court must inform each parent not represented by an attorney of:
(1) the right to be represented by an attorney; and
(2) if a parent is indigent and appears in opposition to
the suit, the right to a court-appointed attorney.
(d) If a parent claims indigence and requests the appointment
of an attorney before the full adversary hearing, the court shall
require the parent to complete and file with the court an affidavit
of indigence. The court may consider additional evidence to
determine whether the parent is indigent, including evidence relating
to the parent's income, source of income, assets, property ownership,
benefits paid in accordance with a federal, state, or local public
assistance program, outstanding obligations, and necessary expenses
and the number and ages of the parent's dependents. If the
appointment of an attorney for the parent is requested, the court
shall make a determination of indigence before commencement of the
full adversary hearing. If the court determines the parent is
indigent, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1376 -
parent.
(e) The court may, for good cause shown, postpone the full
adversary hearing for not more than seven days from the date of the
attorney's appointment to provide the attorney time to respond to the
petition and prepare for the hearing. The court may shorten or
lengthen the extension granted under this subsection if the parent
and the appointed attorney agree in writing. If the court postpones
the full adversary hearing, the court shall extend a temporary order,
temporary restraining order, or attachment issued by the court under
Section 262.102(a) for the protection of the child until the date of
the rescheduled full adversary hearing.
(e-1) If a parent who is not indigent appears in opposition to
the suit, the court may, for good cause shown, postpone the full
adversary hearing for not more than seven days from the date of the
parent's appearance to allow the parent to hire an attorney or to
provide the parent's attorney time to respond to the petition and
prepare for the hearing. A postponement under this subsection is
subject to the limits and requirements prescribed by Subsection (e)
and Section 155.207.
(f) The court shall ask all parties present at the full
adversary hearing whether the child or the child's family has a
Native American heritage and identify any Native American tribe with
which the child may be associated.
(g) In a suit filed under Section 262.101 or 262.105, at the
conclusion of the full adversary hearing, the court shall order the
return of the child to the parent, managing conservator, possessory
conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian entitled to possession
from whom the child is removed unless the court finds sufficient
evidence to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that:
(1) there was a danger to the physical health or safety of
the child, including a danger that the child would be a victim of
trafficking under Section 20A.02 or 20A.03, Penal Code, which was
caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to
possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the
welfare of the child;
(2) the urgent need for protection required the immediate
removal of the child and reasonable efforts, consistent with the
circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to
eliminate or prevent the child's removal; and
(3) reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1377 -
to return home, but there is a substantial risk of a continuing
danger if the child is returned home.
(g-1) In a suit filed under Section 262.101 or 262.105, if the
court does not order the return of the child under Subsection (g) and
finds that another parent, managing conservator, possessory
conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian entitled to possession
did not cause the immediate danger to the physical health or safety
of the child or was not the perpetrator of the neglect or abuse
alleged in the suit, the court shall order possession of the child by
that person unless the court finds sufficient evidence to satisfy a
person of ordinary prudence and caution that, specific to each person
entitled to possession:
(1) the person cannot be located after the exercise of due
diligence by the Department of Family and Protective Services, or the
person is unable or unwilling to take possession of the child; or
(2) reasonable efforts have been made to enable the
person's possession of the child, but possession by that person
presents a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the
child caused by an act or failure to act of the person, including a
danger that the child would be a victim of trafficking under Section
20A.02 or 20A.03, Penal Code.
(g-2) If, at the conclusion of a full adversary hearing, the
court renders an order under Subsection (g) or (g-1), the court must
describe in writing and in a separate section:
(1) the reasonable efforts that were made to enable the
child to return home and the substantial risk of a continuing danger
if the child is returned home, as required by Subsection (g)(3); or
(2) the reasonable efforts that were made to enable a
person's possession of the child and the continuing danger to the
physical health or safety of the child as required by Subsection (g1)(2).
(h) In a suit filed under Section 262.101 or 262.105, if the
court finds sufficient evidence to make the applicable finding under
Subsection (g) or (g-1), the court shall issue an appropriate
temporary order under Chapter 105.
(i) In determining whether there is a continuing danger to the
physical health or safety of the child under Subsection (g), the
court may consider whether the household to which the child would be
returned includes a person who:
(1) has abused or neglected another child in a manner that
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1378 -
caused serious injury to or the death of the other child; or
(2) has sexually abused another child.
(i-1) In making a determination whether there is an immediate
danger to the physical health or safety of a child, the court shall
consider the opinion of a medical professional obtained by the
child's parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator,
guardian, caretaker, or custodian.
(j) Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 8 (H.B. 567),
Sec. 13(3), eff. September 1, 2021.
(k) If the court finds that the child requires protection from
family violence, as that term is defined by Section 71.004, by a
member of the child's family or household, the court shall render a
protective order for the child under Title 4.
(l) The court shall require each parent, alleged father, or
relative of the child before the court to complete the proposed child
placement resources form provided under Section 261.307 and file the
form with the court, if the form has not been previously filed with
the court, and provide the Department of Family and Protective
Services with information necessary to locate any other absent
parent, alleged father, or relative of the child. The court shall
inform each parent, alleged father, or relative of the child before
the court that the person's failure to submit the proposed child
placement resources form will not delay any court proceedings
relating to the child.
(l-1) The court shall ask all parties present at the full
adversary hearing whether:
(1) the child has had the opportunity, in a developmentally
appropriate manner, to identify any adult, particularly an adult
residing in the child's community, who could be a relative or
designated caregiver for the child; and
(2) each individual identified by the child as a potential
relative or designated caregiver is listed on the proposed child
placement resources form.
(m) The court shall inform each parent in open court that
parental and custodial rights and duties may be subject to
restriction or to termination unless the parent or parents are
willing and able to provide the child with a safe environment.
(n) If the court does not order possession of a child by a
parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator, guardian,
caretaker, or custodian entitled to possession under Subsection (g)
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1379 -
or (g-1), the court shall place the child with a relative of the
child unless the court finds that the placement with a relative is
not in the best interest of the child.
(n-1) For a child placed with a relative of the child, the
court shall inform the relative of:
(1) the option to become verified by a licensed childplacing agency to operate an agency foster home, if applicable; and
(2) the permanency care assistance program under Subchapter
K, Chapter 264.
(o) When citation by publication is needed for a parent or
alleged or probable father in an action brought under this chapter
because the location of the parent, alleged father, or probable
father is unknown, the court may render a temporary order without
delay at any time after the filing of the action without regard to
whether notice of the citation by publication has been published.
(p) For the purpose of determining under Subsection (a) the
14th day after the date the child is taken into possession, a child
is considered to have been taken into possession by the Department of
Family and Protective Services on the expiration of the five-day
period permitted under Section 262.007(c) or 262.110(b), as
appropriate.
(q) On receipt of a written request for possession of the child
from a parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator,
guardian, caretaker, or custodian entitled to possession of the child
who was not located before the adversary hearing, the Department of
Family and Protective Services shall notify the court and request a
hearing to determine whether the parent, managing conservator,
possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian is entitled
to possession of the child under Subsection (g-1).

SUBCHAPTER E. FINAL ORDER FOR CHILD UNDER DEPARTMENT CARE
Sec. 263.401. DISMISSAL AFTER ONE YEAR; NEW TRIALS; EXTENSION.
(a) Unless the court has commenced the trial on the merits or
granted an extension under Subsection (b) or (b-1), on the first
Monday after the first anniversary of the date the court rendered a
temporary order appointing the department as temporary managing
conservator, the court's jurisdiction over the suit affecting the
parent-child relationship filed by the department that requests
termination of the parent-child relationship or requests that the
department be named conservator of the child is terminated and the
suit is automatically dismissed without a court order. Not later
than the 60th day before the day the suit is automatically dismissed,
the court shall notify all parties to the suit of the automatic
dismissal date.
(b) Unless the court has commenced the trial on the merits, the
court may not retain the suit on the court's docket after the time
described by Subsection (a) unless the court finds that extraordinary
circumstances necessitate the child remaining in the temporary
managing conservatorship of the department and that continuing the
appointment of the department as temporary managing conservator is in
the best interest of the child. If the court makes those findings,
the court may retain the suit on the court's docket for a period not
to exceed 180 days after the time described by Subsection (a). If
the court retains the suit on the court's docket, the court shall
render an order in which the court:
(1) schedules the new date on which the suit will be
automatically dismissed if the trial on the merits has not commenced,
which date must be not later than the 180th day after the time
described by Subsection (a);
(2) makes further temporary orders for the safety and
welfare of the child as necessary to avoid further delay in resolving
the suit; and
(3) sets the trial on the merits on a date not later than
the date specified under Subdivision (1).
(b-1) If, after commencement of the initial trial on the merits
within the time required by Subsection (a) or (b), the court grants a
motion for a new trial or mistrial, or the case is remanded to the
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1441 -
court by an appellate court following an appeal of the court's final
order, the court shall retain the suit on the court's docket and
render an order in which the court:
(1) schedules a new date on which the suit will be
automatically dismissed if the new trial has not commenced, which
must be a date not later than the 180th day after the date on which:
(A) the motion for a new trial or mistrial is granted;
or
(B) the appellate court remanded the case;
(2) makes further temporary orders for the safety and
welfare of the child as necessary to avoid further delay in resolving
the suit; and
(3) sets the new trial on the merits for a date not later
than the date specified under Subdivision (1).
(b-2) When considering under Subsection (b) whether to find
that extraordinary circumstances necessitate the child remaining in
the temporary managing conservatorship of the department for a case
in which the court orders a parent to complete a substance abuse
treatment program, the court shall consider whether the parent made a
good faith effort to successfully complete the program.
(b-3) A court shall find under Subsection (b) that
extraordinary circumstances necessitate the child remaining in the
temporary managing conservatorship of the department if:
(1) a parent of a child has made a good faith effort to
successfully complete the service plan but needs additional time; and
(2) on completion of the service plan the court intends to
order the child returned to the parent.
(c) If the court grants an extension under Subsection (b) or
(b-1) but does not commence the trial on the merits before the
dismissal date, the court's jurisdiction over the suit is terminated
and the suit is automatically dismissed without a court order. The
court may not grant an additional extension that extends the suit
beyond the required date for dismissal under Subsection (b) or (b-1),
as applicable.

Sec. 263.403. MONITORED RETURN OF CHILD TO PARENT. (a)
Notwithstanding Section 263.401, the court may retain jurisdiction

16 YEARS OF AGE. (a) A foster child who is at least 16 years of age
may consent to the provision of medical care, except as provided by
Chapter 33, if the court with continuing jurisdiction determines that
the child has the capacity to consent to medical care. If the child
provides consent by signing a consent form, the form must be written
in language the child can understand.
(b) A court with continuing jurisdiction may make the
determination regarding the foster child's capacity to consent to
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1610 -
medical care during a hearing under Chapter 263 or may hold a hearing
to make the determination on its own motion. The court may issue an
order authorizing the child to consent to all or some of the medical
care as defined by Section 266.001. In addition, a foster child who
is at least 16 years of age, or the foster child's attorney ad litem,
may file a petition with the court for a hearing. If the court
determines that the foster child lacks the capacity to consent to
medical care, the court may consider whether the foster child has
acquired the capacity to consent to medical care at subsequent
hearings under Section 263.5031.
(c) If the court determines that a foster child lacks the
capacity to consent to medical care, the person authorized by the
court under Section 266.004 shall continue to provide consent for the
medical care of the foster child.
(d) If a foster child who is at least 16 years of age and who
has been determined to have the capacity to consent to medical care
refuses to consent to medical care and the department or private
agency providing substitute care or case management services to the
child believes that the medical care is appropriate, the department
or the private agency may file a motion with the court requesting an
order authorizing the provision of the medical care.
(e) The motion under Subsection (d) must include:
(1) the child's stated reasons for refusing the medical
care; and
(2) a statement prepared and signed by the treating
physician that the medical care is the proper course of treatment for
the foster child.
(f) If a motion is filed under Subsection (d), the court shall
appoint an attorney ad litem for the foster child if one has not
already been appointed. The foster child's attorney ad litem shall:
(1) discuss the situation with the child;
(2) discuss the suitability of the medical care with the
treating physician;
(3) review the child's medical and mental health records;
and
(4) advocate to the court on behalf of the child's
expressed preferences regarding the medical care.
(g) The court shall issue an order authorizing the provision of
the medical care in accordance with a motion under Subsection (d) to
the foster child only if the court finds, by clear and convincing
FAMILY CODE
Statute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 1611 -
evidence, after the hearing that the medical care is in the best
interest of the foster child and:
(1) the foster child lacks the capacity to make a decision
regarding the medical care;
(2) the failure to provide the medical care will result in
an observable and material impairment to the growth, development, or
functioning of the foster child; or
(3) the foster child is at risk of suffering substantial
bodily harm or of inflicting substantial bodily harm to others.
(h) In making a decision under this section regarding whether a
foster child has the capacity to consent to medical care, the court
shall consider:
(1) the maturity of the child;
(2) whether the child is sufficiently well informed to make
a decision regarding the medical care; and
(3) the child's intellectual functioning.
(i) In determining whether the medical care is in the best
interest of the foster child, the court shall consider:
(1) the foster child's expressed preference regarding the
medical care, including perceived risks and benefits of the medical
care;
(2) likely consequences to the foster child if the child
does not receive the medical care;
(3) the foster child's prognosis, if the child does receive
the medical care; and
(4) whether there are alternative, less intrusive
treatments that are likely to reach the same result as provision of
the medical care.
(j) This section does not apply to emergency medical care. An
emergency relating to a foster child who is at least 16 years of age,
other than a child in an inpatient mental health facility, is
governed by Section 266.009.
(k) This section does not apply to the administration of
medication under Subchapter G, Chapter 574, Health and Safety Code,
to a foster child who is at least 16 years of age and who is placed
in an inpatient mental health facility.
(l) Before a foster child reaches the age of 16, the department
or the private agency providing substitute care or case management
services to the foster child shall advise the foster child of the
right to a hearing under this section to determine whether the foster

child may consent to medical care. The department or the private
agency providing substitute care or case management services shall
provide the foster child with training on informed consent and the

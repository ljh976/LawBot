The\ncourt shall inform the child that the court is not required to accept\nthe agreement. The court may delay a decision on whether to accept\nthe agreement until after reviewing a report filed under Section\n54.04(b). If the court decides not to accept the agreement, the\ncourt shall inform the child of the court's decision and give the\nchild an opportunity to withdraw the plea or stipulation of evidence.\nIf the court rejects the agreement, no document, testimony, or other\nevidence placed before the court that relates to the rejected\nagreement may be considered by the court in a subsequent hearing in\nthe case.

If the court accepts the agreement, the court\nshall make a disposition in accordance with the terms of the\nagreement between the state and the child.\nActs 1973, 63rd Leg., p. 1460, ch. 544, Sec. 1, eff.

INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES\nARTICLE I\nPURPOSE\nThe compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that\neach state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of\njuveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or\nparole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision\nand control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the\nsafety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each\nstate is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run\naway from home and in doing so have left their state of residence.\nThe compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the\nCrime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and\nencouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in\nthe prevention of crime.\nIt is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and\ncooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) ensure that\nthe juveniles who are moved under this compact to another state for\nprobation or parole supervision and services are governed in the\nreceiving state by the same standards that apply to juveniles\nreceiving such supervision and services in the receiving state; (B)\nensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including\nFAMILY CODE\nStatute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 459 -\nthe victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving\nstates are adequately protected and balanced with the juvenile's and\nthe juvenile's family's best interests and welfare when an interstate\nmovement is under consideration; (C) return juveniles who have run\naway, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been\naccused of an offense to the state requesting their return through a\nfair and prompt judicial review process that ensures that the\nrequisition is in order and that the transport is properly\nsupervised; (D) make provisions for contracts between member states\nfor the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in\nmember states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E)\nprovide for the effective tracking of juveniles who move interstate\nunder the compact's provisions; (F) equitably allocate the costs,\nbenefits, and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish\nprocedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile\noffenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts,\njuvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice\nagency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders, ensuring that\na receiving state accepts supervision of a juvenile when the\njuvenile's parent or other person having legal custody resides or is\nundertaking residence there; (H) ensure immediate notice to\njurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to\nrelocate across state lines; (I) establish a system of uniform data\ncollection on information pertaining to juveniles who move interstate\nunder this compact that prevents public disclosure of identity and\nindividual treatment information but allows access by authorized\njuvenile justice and criminal justice officials and regular reporting\nof compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and\nlegislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice\nadministrators; (J) monitor compliance with rules governing\ninterstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to\naddress and correct noncompliance; (K) coordinate training and\neducation regarding the regulation of interstate movement of\njuveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (L) coordinate\nthe implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate\nCompact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for\nAdult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles\nparticularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping\nsupervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states\nthat the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created\nFAMILY CODE\nStatute text rendered on: 4/8/2025 - 460 -\nherein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public\nbusiness.
